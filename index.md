## A Note on Themes & Content Warnings

**Please read before continuing.**

Hello, and welcome to Anastaria! Before you dive into this world, it's important to us that you have a clear understanding of the themes and potential content you may encounter. This campaign is a collaborative story, and our primary goal is to ensure everyone at the table feels safe and has a good time. Please review the following themes, and if any of them are a concern for you, please don't hesitate to speak with a Director, Dungeon Master, or Administrator.

## Insects (Entomophobia)

The native life of Anastaria is distinctly alien, and a major part of that ecosystem is insectoid in nature. The dominant sentient species, the T'choac, are insect-like, as are many of the common monsters and beasts. Descriptions of chitin, mandibles, swarms, and other insect-related themes will be a regular part of the game.

(Note: This theme is specific to insectoid creatures like mantises, beetles, and humanoids with chitinous plates. We have deliberately avoided including spiders or other arachnids in the world's bestiary.)

## Body Horror

The chaotic, life-giving nature of the Wyld has a profound and often grotesque effect on living flesh. This is a central theme of the setting. You can expect to encounter themes of unwanted physical transformation, parasitic infection (the Kaotikoi's tadpoles), disease, and the blending of flesh with plant, fungus, or stone (Wyld petrification, the Wilted). We will strive to keep descriptions narrative, but the horror of losing control of one's own body is a key element of the world.

## Survival & Desperation

Fortitude is a desperate frontier settlement, not a shining city. The campaign will touch on themes of poverty, food scarcity, and the morally grey choices people make when their survival is on the line.

## Exile & Social Ostracism

The core premise for many characters is that they have been cast out of their home society. The game will explore feelings of loss, loneliness, and the struggle to build a new community after being deemed an outcast.

## Political Corruption & Betrayal

The factions of Fortitude are rife with secrets, backstabbing, and manipulation. The world is not black and white, and players should be prepared for a setting where allies might not be what they seem and doing the "right thing" is often complicated.
