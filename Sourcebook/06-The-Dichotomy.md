# The Great Dichotomy

## The Loom

The home reality of humans, elves, and dwarves, defined by structure, logic, and predictable laws. After a millennium of peace under the "Great Accord," its society has become incredibly safe but rigid and stifling. Magic is treated as a complex, ordered science. Order is paramount.

## The Wyld

A reality of pure instinct, chaotic energy, and raw, untamed life. It is not evil, but a profoundly alien environment that changes those within it, eroding rigid logic in favor of honed instinct and primal attunement. Chaos is the natural state.
