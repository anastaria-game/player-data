# Currency in Anastaria

## Wyld Shards

The primary currency of Anastaria is the Wyld Shard, a crystalline token infused with the chaotic energy of the Wyld. These shards are what is left over from the delicate process of carving raw crystal ore into the perfect, flawless gemstones that are the city's primary export back to the Loom. The act of cutting these gems shatters the ore, leaving behind a wealth of unusable but still potent fragments. These fragments are then crafted into currency through a specialized process known only to the [Cog & Covenant](09-Factions.md#cog-n-covenant). One chunk of raw ore can be cut into many coins of varying denominations, ensuring a steady supply despite the ore's scarcity. The final product is an iridescent black, slightly cupped octagon with a metal-banded edge, symbolizing the blend of Wyld chaos and Loom order. They are not mere coins but living fragments of the world's essence, pulsing with faint, unpredictable light. The currency reflects the fractured, unstable nature of Anastaria, where value is tied to the Wyld's raw power.

### The Varieties

Wyld Shards come in three denominations, each worth 10 times the lower one. They are named for their size and the Wyld's influence:

* ***ð* Dreg (Smallest):** The smallest denomination, one-half inch in diameter, appears dull compared to the others, with minimal iridescence. It represents the "dregs" or remnants of order in the Threshold near Fortitude. These are small, gritty shards used for everyday transactions like buying food, lodging in the Shambles, or minor repairs.

* ***ʃ* Fleck (10 Dregs):** A medium-sized shard, three-quarters of an inch in diameter, appears more refined with a sparkling, shifting glimmer across its surface. It symbolizes a small "fleck" of chaos from the Penumbra. These are used for significant purchases like weapons, armor, or hiring guides for expeditions.

* ***ʂ* Shard (100 Dregs):** The largest and rarest denomination, a full inch in diameter, appears to have a colorful, pulsating pattern playing across its surface. It embodies the full "shard" of pure Wyld energy from the Deep Wyld. These are reserved for high-value transactions such as buying Vanhir artifacts, securing faction alliances, or funding major expeditions.

### Using Wyld Shards

Wyld Shards are accepted throughout Fortitude, though barter is a common alternative.
