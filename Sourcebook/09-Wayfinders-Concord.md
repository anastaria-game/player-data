# The Wayfinders' Concord

Knowledge is the Lantern in the Wyld.

In the heart of Fortitude, within the hallowed halls of the Weirwood Athenaeum, lies the city's greatest weapon against the encroaching Wyld: shared knowledge. Founded by the loremaster Marius Vance after the tragic loss of the Dawnfire Company, the Concord is a pact among adventurers. Its purpose is simple but vital: to ensure that no one ever has to face the same unknown threat twice. Contributing your findings to the Concord's archives is the primary means by which you gain Renown in Fortitude, for your reputation is built on what you give back to the community.

## Registry Points (RP)

Upon returning from an expedition, your party can submit an adventure log (maps, notes, samples) to a Concord Chronicler. Verified discoveries earn Registry Points (RP), which are divided equally among the party members present. The character submitting the log determines how any indivisible remainder of RP is distributed.

* **Lifetime RP:** Your character's total cumulative RP earned. This score never decreases and determines your Concord Standing.
* **Current RP:** The points your character has available to spend on Concord services.

| Contribution | RP Awarded | Notes & Bonuses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mapping a New Hex | 1 per hex | +1 for detailed annotations (terrain, hazards). |
| New Discovery (Flora, Fauna, Mineral) | 1-3 | Requires a viable sample for study. RP value is based on the discovery's significance. |
| Locating a Vanhir Ruin | 2 | +2 bonus for mapping the ruin's interior layout. |
| Identifying a Creature's Weakness or Trait | 2-4 | Value based on threat level. Requires compelling evidence (e.g., a witness account, recovered parts). |
| Completing a Concord Bounty | Variable | The Concord posts bounties for specific information (e.g., "Find a safe passage through the Mirewoods"). |

## Available Retainers

### Hiring a Retainer

A party with Chartered standing can hire one retainer from a faction before an expedition. The cost of hiring a retainer is a combination of a daily fee and a cut of the profits, ensuring the hireling is as invested in the outcome as the party itself.

* **Cost:** Hiring a retainer costs **2 shards (Ê‚) per day**, paid in advance. The retainer is also entitled to a **10% cut of all gold and treasure** found during the expedition.

### Retainer Roles

Each faction provides a different type of retainer, reflecting their unique skill sets and goals.
