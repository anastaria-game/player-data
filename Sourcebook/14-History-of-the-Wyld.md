# History of the Wyld

This won't be on the test, but if you want to dig into the history of Anastaria, here's some relevant details.

## The Great Accord

For a thousand years, the major powers of the Loom—from the sprawling human empires to the ancient Elven courts and the deep mountain-homes of the Dwarves—have known an unprecedented era of peace. Forged in the aftermath of a devastating magical cataclysm, the Great Accord is a complex web of non-aggression treaties and trade agreements that has made large-scale warfare a distant, almost mythical, memory. Generations have been born and died without ever knowing the horrors of a true war, and the world has become a place of profound order, stability, and predictability.

## The Price of Peace

But a world without conflict is also a world without change. Over the centuries, the great governments of the Loom grew more rigid, more set in their ways, and more autocratic. With no external enemies to fight, they turned their attention inward, enforcing social order with an ever-heavier hand. Societies that once celebrated heroes and innovators began to see them as threats to the delicate peace. Ambitious warriors with no wars to win, brilliant mages pushing the boundaries of "safe" magic, and explorers who yearned for the horizon became dissidents. Criminals, malcontents, and even those who were simply "different" were viewed as cracks in the perfect, placid surface of their society.

## The Azure Veil

It was in this stifling atmosphere that the Azure Veil came together. A secret society of the Loom's most brilliant and ambitious mages, they chafed under the dogmatic restrictions placed upon their art by the ruling magical councils. They saw the Great Accord not as a golden age, but as a gilded cage. Operating in hidden laboratories, far from the prying eyes of the authorities, they dedicated themselves to a single, heretical goal: to find a source of new, untamed magic, and with it, a path to true intellectual and arcane freedom. Their research into the theory of "planar echoes" would ultimately lead them to Anastaria, and in their desperate search for freedom, they would unleash a cage of a very different kind upon the worlds.

## Creation of the Gate

The story of the Azure Veil's discovery.

### The Breakthrough

After years of clandestine research, Archmage Elara Vorin and the mages of the Azure Veil achieved the impossible. In a hidden laboratory at the top of a remote, abandoned tower, they performed a grand ritual that bent the very fabric of reality, successfully tearing open a stable rift to what they believed was a pristine, untouched "planar echo" of their own world. Before them shimmered a silent, vertical curtain of silvery light—a doorway to a new world, and the culmination of their life's work.

### The First Crossing

The first expedition was a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. Thirteen of the coven's most powerful mages, led by Elara herself, stepped through the shimmering portal. They found not a pristine source of magic, but a world of raw, untamed chaos that was actively hostile to their ordered reality. Their magic, the precise and predictable art of the Loom, did not simply fail in the Wyld—it unraveled with explosive, horrifying violence.

Tales told by the few survivors speak of simple Shield spells that petrified the air into jagged shrapnel, and teleportation rituals that grotesquely fused casters with the local flora. Of the thirteen who entered, only four returned. Two were dead, their bodies already hosts to alien fungi. One was driven permanently mad, his mind shattered by the psychic "hum" of a world that sang a hateful song. The last was Elara Vorin, traumatized and forever changed by what she had witnessed.

### The Great Unmaking

The true horror of their ritual was revealed the moment the first mage stepped through. The Gate was not merely a door; it was an engine that required a terrible price. The instant the threshold was crossed, a wave of grey annihilation erupted from the portal's lowest point. In a silent, terrifying flash, everything in a five-mile radius on the Anastarian side—from the ground beneath their feet to the sky above—was simply disintegrated, ceasing to exist. What was left behind was a perfectly flat, fifty-foot-high circular cliff of bedrock: the Bastion Butte.

The mages of the Azure Veil were only saved from their own folly by their paranoia. When the four survivors stumbled back through the Gate to the top of their tower on the Loom, the same cataclysm occurred on their home side. A wave of annihilation erupted horizontally, disintegrating the top of the tower and everything in a five-mile radius at that elevation. The only things harmed beyond the tower itself were the tops of the tallest trees and any unfortunate birds caught in the blast, leaving a bizarre, perfectly sheared-off canopy line in the surrounding forest as the only evidence of their catastrophic success.

### A Wound in the World

Despite the unmitigated disaster, the coven's ritual had succeeded in one critical aspect: the Gate remained. The shimmering, silvery portal became a permanent, stable wound between the worlds. The Azure Veil's secret was soon discovered by the authorities of the Loom, and what began as a quest for arcane freedom would soon become the perfect solution for a society desperate to be rid of its unwanted souls.

## Exile of Elara Vorin

The aftermath of the First Crossing.

### The Reckoning

The disastrous return of the Azure Veil survivors sent shockwaves through the magical and political establishments of the Loom. The secret of their forbidden research was out, and the existence of the Gate—a permanent, reality-destroying wound in the world—was a crisis that could not be ignored. The ruling councils convened an emergency tribunal, and Elara Vorin, as the coven's leader, was brought forth to answer for her actions.

### The Trial of the Century

The ponderous, bureaucratic governments of the Loom, long out of practice with matters of high treason, did not act swiftly. Immediately after her capture, Elara gave a single, chilling testimony: she claimed sole responsibility for the entire catastrophe, insisting she had coerced her associates into assisting her through extortion. Having thus shielded her coven from the worst of the blame, she refused to speak another word. Even under the most rigorous interrogation, she remained silent, consumed by a guilt that no one else could comprehend.

Her silence only fueled the public's hunger for drama in a world starved for entertainment. With the main defendant refusing to cooperate, the trial swelled into a spectacle that lasted for years. Innumerable "expert" witnesses were called, testimony was heard from everyone from Elara's childhood friends to distant classmates, and every detail of the Azure Veil's research was picked apart for the salacious enjoyment of the masses. After years of excruciatingly slow and public deliberation, she was inevitably found guilty.

### The First Exile

The council, fearing martyrdom if they executed her and rebellion if they did not act, devised a unique and terrible sentence. Elara Vorin was given a choice: life imprisonment in the most secure and bleak dungeon the Loom could devise, or a one-way ticket back to the hell of her own making. To the shock of the world, Elara chose the Gate. Shamed, broken, but with a flicker of defiance, she willingly stepped back through the shimmering portal, becoming the first and most famous of the Exiles.

Her decision was a pivotal moment in history. It would be remembered years later when the governments of the Loom, faced with burgeoning prison populations and a growing number of dissidents, realized they had been given the perfect solution. Elara's choice paved the way for the "dumping ground" policy, turning her personal punishment into the fate of thousands to come.

## Struggle for the Lantern

The desperate founding of Fortitude.

### The Loom-Side Defense

While the governments of the Loom began their long, drawn-out trial of Elara Vorin, the Gate remained a bleeding wound in their reality. The first official expeditions, composed of contingents of what would become the Wardens and a team of the Loom's finest artificers led by Bartholomew Weir, established a fortified position on the Loom side. Their initial strategy was simple: use the Gate as a perfect choke-point to hold back any incursions from the new world.

### The Failing Choke-Point

The strategy was a catastrophic failure. The defenders quickly learned that the Wyld was not a conventional enemy. Its influence bled through the portal. The constant, disorienting "hum" frayed the nerves of the soldiers, magic became unreliable, and strange flora began to sprout from the very stones of their fortifications. Worse, the incursions were relentless. The defenders were fighting a losing battle against a foe that didn't need to sleep and whose very presence warped the reality they were trying to defend.

### Weir's Gambit

It was Bartholomew Weir, working from the relative safety of the Loom-side camp, who realized the fundamental truth of their situation: the Wyld could not be fought, it had to be overwritten. He conceived of and drafted the schematics for a massive magi-tech engine that would impose the ordered reality of the Loom in a bubble around the Gate. Materials were gathered and preparations were made, but Weir was faced with a critical, seemingly impossible problem: he had no idea how to power it. No Loom-based power source could hope to counteract the overwhelming chaos of an entire world.

### The First Light

The breakthrough came from a daring scouting mission. A young artificer named *Orin Vance* returned from the Wyld with a strange, pulsing crystal harvested from the corpse of a "Skymantid." Weir and his team immediately recognized it for what it was: a perfect, concentrated source of the Wyld's own chaotic energy. They deduced that this "Resonance Gland" could be refined and used to fuel their engine, turning the Wyld's own power against itself.

This realization forced a terrifying new strategy. The Lantern had to be built on the Wyld side, close to its fuel source. The defenders abandoned their failed Loom-side fortress and crossed the Gate in force, establishing a desperate foothold on the barren rock of the Bastion Butte. The construction of what would come to be known as Weir's Lantern became the single, unifying focus of the entire colony, a race against time fueled by the first brave hunters sent on suicidal missions to harvest Resonance Glands. After years of brutal struggle, the Lantern was finally activated. For the first time, a steady, calming light pushed back the eternal twilight, and the city of Fortitude was truly born.

## The Era of Construction

The Golden Years of Fortitude.

### A Time of Hope

With the successful activation of Weir's Lantern, the colony entered a period of unprecedented stability and growth. For nearly two decades, the settlers were not just surviving; they were building. This "Era of Construction" was a time of great optimism, fueled by well-funded expeditions from the Loom and the promise of a new, secure foothold in a world of endless resources. It was during this time that the city of Fortitude truly took shape.

### The Founding of the Ring

Wealthy wizard enclaves, powerful merchant guilds (which would later coalesce into the Combine), and state-sponsored artisans flocked to the new world. With the safety of the Lantern's Threshold, they were able to build permanent structures. Using stone quarried directly from the Bastion Butte, they constructed the grand manors, sturdy guildhalls, and imposing towers of the Founders' Ring. The Combine Spire, the Bastion Barracks, and the Weirwood Athenaeum are all relics of this hopeful and prosperous era.

### The Glimmerflow Cisterns

One of the first and most vital civic projects was the improvement of the Glimmerflow Spring. Under the direction of the [Cog & Covenant](09-Factions.md#cog-n-covenant) and with the labor of [The Wardens](09-Factions.md#the-wardens), the raw cavern was transformed. A complex system of magi-tech pumps and stone-carved aqueducts was installed, creating a network of cisterns and public fountains that could efficiently distribute fresh water throughout the growing city. This engineering marvel ensured the health of the populace and stands as a testament to the ingenuity of the early settlers.

### The Seeds of Division

It was also during this era that the major factions solidified their power bases, each carving out their own niche in the burgeoning city. While they worked together for the common goal of survival, the seeds of their future conflicts—the Combine's relentless pursuit of profit, the Wardens' grim pragmatism, and the Seekers' quiet reverence for the Wyld—were already beginning to take root, setting the stage for the tensions that would define the city for decades to come.

## The Exile Influx

The end of an era, the beginning of a new one.

### The End of the Gold Rush

The "Era of Construction" was fueled by a gold rush mentality. Dozens of smaller, speculative ventures from the Loom charged into Anastaria, expecting riches beyond their wildest dreams. For a time, they found it. But the Wyld is a meat grinder. The true cost of operating in such a hostile land quickly became apparent as casualties mounted and supply lines were constantly harassed. The demand for higher hazard pay for miners and guards skyrocketed, and the initial flood of exotic minerals and chitin began to ebb. The novelty wore off, and profits plummeted.

Over a period of about five years, this economic reality check led to a great bust. One by one, the smaller companies went bankrupt, abandoning their claims and pulling out of Anastaria. Ever pragmatically, [The Combine](09-Factions.md#the-combine) took full advantage, snapping up their failed rivals' equipment, claims, and best personnel for a fraction of their worth. The era of hopeful, independent expeditions had trickled to a close, leaving The Combine as the sole, dominant corporate power, focused only on the highest-profit concerns and pushing production as fast as possible.

### The Loom's "Solution"

With the initial investment boom over and the world now seen as a high-risk, low-reward venture, the governments of the Loom faced a new crisis: their prisons were overflowing, and their societies had no outlet for their dissidents. Remembering the "successful" exile of the Archmage, they arrived at a chillingly pragmatic solution. The Gate to Anastaria would become the pressure valve for their stagnant peace, and a new, official policy was born: Anastaria was now a penal colony.

### The First Wave & The Birth of the Shambles

The arrival of the first transport ships filled with hardened criminals, political prisoners, and desperate outcasts was a culture shock from which Fortitude would never recover. The proud settlers of the Founders' Ring were horrified. With no resources or housing provided for the newcomers, a sprawling, chaotic shantytown erupted on the open plains of the butte outside the established city. This was the birth of the Shambles—a district built from scavenged wood, salvaged chitin, and pure desperation.

### Conflict in the Gardens

At the time, the city's primary food source came from the sprawling agricultural compounds [The Seekers](09-Factions.md#the-seekers) had established in the fertile soil of the butte's outer ring. These open fields and greenhouses became the first and easiest targets for the new, starving population of hardened criminals. The Seeker compounds were raided so thoroughly and regularly that the city's food supply was threatened, and the pacifist Seekers were unable to stop the violence.

### The Walls Within

In response to this crisis, the Wardens undertook a massive new construction project. They erected the 20-foot-high wooden palisade that now separates the residential Shambles from the newly formalized and protected "Garden Ring." To control the flow of people and goods, passage was restricted to four main corridors at the cardinal directions, each heavily guarded by a permanent Warden presence. This act forever changed the layout and the character of Fortitude, turning it into a city of walls within walls, a place of formalized division and simmering resentment between the districts.

### The Building of the Bulwark

With the Garden Ring secured but a massive population of unemployed and starving convicts now contained in the Shambles, [The Combine](09-Factions.md#the-combine) saw an opportunity. In a public gesture of "civic duty," they offered to fund and oversee the construction of the city's great outer wall, The Bulwark. They "employed" thousands of Exiles from the Shambles, paying them in Combine scrip redeemable only for food bricks and cramped housing—essentially a form of indentured servitude. For years, this desperate workforce labored to haul the massive petrified logs and jagged monster parts from the Penumbra, adding the final layers to the original stone wall and creating the formidable defense that stands today. This project cemented the [The Combine](09-Factions.md#the-combine)'s power, enriched its coffers, and formalized the desperate, dependent status of the city's newest arrivals.
