# The World and Its Zones

Survival in Anastaria is only possible due to Weir's Lantern, a massive magi-tech device that actively projects a bubble of stable, Loom-like reality into the chaos of the Wyld. This effect, known as the Loom's Imprint, diminishes smoothly with distance from Fortitude. While the field is roughly circular, its edges are not perfect, sometimes pushing further into the Wyld in some areas while receding in others. For the sake of navigation and survival, the people of Fortitude have defined three general "zones," which mark the distances at which the Wyld's influence definitively begins to overwhelm the Lantern's, rather than a hard, clear line.

## The Anastarian Sky

Anastaria does not have a sun or moon in the traditional sense. Its sky is dominated by the awe-inspiring presence of a massive gas giant that hangs in the heavens, its swirling bands of green and purple clouds providing the world's constant, soft twilight. The settlers of Fortitude named it the *Veridian Eye*. There are no stars, only faint, distant nebulae. The gas giant has two major, visible moons of its own, known to the settlers as "The Sisters."

* **The Silent Sister:** A large, barren, pockmarked moon of grey rock. It reflects the Veridian Eye's light with a flat, unwavering intensity. When it is full in the sky, the nights are noticeably brighter.
* **The Weeping Sister:** A smaller moon composed almost entirely of ice. It is highly reflective and sheds a constant, faint tail of vapor and ice crystals as it orbits, giving it the appearance of a gently weeping eye. When the Weeping Sister is full, the humidity on Anastaria rises, and strange, magical fogs are more common.

### The Imposed Day

To maintain a semblance of normalcy and regulate civic life, Weir's Lantern simulates a 24-hour day/night cycle within the Threshold. During the 16-hour "Daylight" phase, the Lantern emits a bright, cool, bluish light. This fades into an 8-hour "Dim" phase, where the Lantern's glow is a soft, reddish twilight, marking the time for rest. This imposed cycle governs the work and sleep schedules of everyone in Fortitude.

Travelers venturing into the timeless wilds of the Penumbra rely on *timepieces*: small, magically attuned orbs that replicate the Lantern's light cycle. These are essential tools for tracking the passage of time, coordinating watches, and staving off the mental fatigue of living in a world without a sunrise.

## The Threshold (The "Safe" Zone)

The area immediately surrounding Fortitude, where the Lantern's effect is strongest. Reality and magic are stable and predictable. The constant, living "hum" of the Wyld is a barely perceptible whisper, a low thrumming pressure that is easily ignored after a few days. The sky is a constant, soft twilight, lit by the swirling green and purple of the Veridian Eye. While safer than the outer zones, it is far from harmless.

### Terrain

The landscape here is the most familiar, consisting of rolling plains, navigable forests, and stable ground. Established trade routes and [The Wardens](09-Factions.md#the-wardens) patrols have worn clear, reliable trails through the wilderness. It is the most Earth-like of the zones.

### Humidity

The air is temperate and comfortable, with a humidity level that would feel normal to someone from the Loom. It's breathable and clear, carrying the scents of alien pine and strange flowers.

### Flora

The plant life here is the most "normal," closely resembling the forests and plains of the Loom. However, Anastarian strangeness still bleeds through. Trees may have bark with the texture of smooth stone, and flowers might bloom in impossible colors. Patches of razorgrass are a common hazard off the main trails.

* **Glimmerwood Trees:** A common type of pine-like tree whose sap contains faintly bioluminescent algae, causing entire forests to emit a soft, ethereal glow after dusk.
* **Iron-Rattle Poppies:** Hardy, rust-colored flowers with seed pods that are hard as pebbles. In the wind, a field of them creates a distinctive, dry rattling sound.

### Fauna

The animal life is a blend of the familiar and the alien. Six-legged grazers resembling deer roam the plains, and chitin-shelled rodents scurry through the undergrowth. Zephyr-Hares are an incredibly common sight. Predators tend to be small, solitary hunters like large stalking lizards or heavily-built, badger-like mammals.

## The Penumbra (The Borderlands)

A vast, transitional borderland where the Lantern's projection weakens and struggles against the Wyld. The laws of physics and magic become frayed and unpredictable. The "hum" is a noticeable, distracting thrum that can cause headaches and unease in the unprepared. The landscape grows more alien, with strange rock formations and bizarre, oversized flora.

### Terrain

This is where the world becomes broken and treacherous. The plains give way to petrified forests of stone-like trees, treacherous swamps, and bizarre, twisted rock formations. The ground is uneven, and established trails are rare and often unreliable. Navigating the Penumbra requires constant vigilance.

### Humidity

The humidity is noticeably higher and more oppressive here. In the swamps and forests, the air becomes thick, heavy, and cloying with the smell of decay, strange sap, and Glimmer-Pollen. It clings to your skin and makes breathing feel like more of an effort.

### Flora

Plants in the Penumbra are often actively hostile. Entire fields of razorgrass can halt a caravan in its tracks, and many plants have developed predatory or hallucinogenic properties as a defense mechanism. The trees here are often petrified wood, hard as stone, or weep strange, alchemically potent sap.

* **Choke-Vines:** Thick, powerful vines that can sense heat and movement, actively constricting any creature that wanders too close.
* **Glimmer-Pollen Poppies:** Beautiful, glowing flowers that release clouds of pollen causing vivid hallucinations and suggestibility, making travelers easy prey for the region's predators.

### Fauna

This is the primary hunting ground for Anastaria's more formidable monsters. Packs of Skymantids are the dominant aerial threat, and territorial Grave-Maws can be found in swamps and petrified forests. The more dangerous creatures from the bestiary, like Grove-Mites and The Wilted, are common encounters. This is the true frontier, where the ecosystem is actively trying to kill and consume outsiders.

## The Deep Wyld (The Untamed)

The true, untamed Anastaria, beyond the Lantern's influence. Here, the Wyld's chaotic nature is absolute. Magic is wild and dangerous, the world reacts to events with spontaneous biological changes, and the "hum" is an overwhelming, psychic song that can break the minds of those who are not acclimated to it. The landscape is a surreal, ever-changing dreamscape of impossible beauty and terrifying life.

### Terrain

The concept of "terrain" as a static thing breaks down. The ground itself might be a single, living organism. You would find surreal landscapes like forests of self-illuminating crystal, vast plains of psychically-linked grass that murmur as you pass, and rivers of a fluid that looks and flows like mercury. The entire environment is an active, shifting entity.

### Humidity

The humidity is oppressively high and unnatural. The air is super-saturated not just with water, but with a thick mixture of spores, pollen, and raw magical energy. It would feel like breathing in a thick, living soup, and the air itself would seem to shimmer at the edges of your vision.

### Flora

The distinction between plant, fungus, and mineral blurs. Entire forests of crystalline trees can focus the dim light of the Veridian Eye into searing beams. Rivers of what looks like mercury flow through fields of moss that sings in response to movement. The very ground can be alive, a single, continent-spanning organism.

* **Migratory Forests:** Groves of colossal, ancient trees that can slowly uproot themselves and migrate across the landscape over the course of decades, following shifts in the Wyld's energy.
* **The Murmuring Veldt:** Vast plains of grass-like organisms that are psychically linked. They can communicate simple concepts—like the presence of intruders—across hundreds of miles in an instant.

### Fauna

The Deep Wyld is home to the true apex predators of Anastaria—ancient, colossal creatures that have never been seen by Loom-born eyes. The Kaotikoi are found on its fringes, a sign that reality itself is breaking down. Survival here is not a matter of skill, but of instinct. Creatures here may not hunt with tooth and claw, but with psychic attacks, reality warping, and biological agents that defy all known science. It is a place of god-like monsters and profound, alien wonder.
