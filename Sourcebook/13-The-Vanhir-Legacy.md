# The Vanhir Legacy

Scattered across the perilous landscapes of the Penumbra and beyond are ruins of an impossible nature. They are the only evidence of a long-dead, impossibly advanced civilization that the Exiles have named "The Vanhir," after a mythical race of artisans from the legends of the Loom. Who they were, how they built such wonders, and what became of them is the greatest mystery in Anastaria.

## The Ruins

Vanhir ruins are unmistakable. They are structures of seamless, cyclopean stone, often carved with flowing, geometric patterns that defy the logic of the Loom. There are no mortar lines, no visible jointsâ€”only massive, perfectly fitted blocks of an unknown, obsidian-like material. These ruins dot the landscape, from lonely, weathered monoliths in the plains to vast, subterranean complexes half-submerged in swamps. The walls are often covered in flowing, indecipherable runes that seem to shift slightly when not directly observed. To date, no one has been able to translate them.

## The Artifacts of the Wyld

The true prize of the Vanhir ruins are the artifacts found within. These items possess a unique and highly sought-after form of magic.

* **Scaling Power:** Vanhir magic items seem to bond with their wielder. A weapon that is a simple magical blade in the hands of a novice will awaken with new, powerful abilities as its owner grows in experience and skill. These items grow with their user, making them incredibly valuable long-term assets.

* **The Wyld Attunement:** Vanhir magic is intrinsically tied to the chaotic nature of Anastaria. Within the Wyld, these items feel potent and alive. If taken back through the Gate to the Loom, their power is greatly diminished, feeling sluggish and muted, as if they are gasping for air in a foreign reality.

* **Art & Treasure:** Beyond weapons and tools, the Vanhir created intricate jewelry and breathtaking works of art from strange metals and luminous crystals. These items are not always magical, but their alien beauty and exquisite craftsmanship are so prized by the nobles of the Loom that they have become a primary trade good, funding many of the expeditions out of Fortitude.

## A New Frontier

The discovery of the Vanhir ruins has ignited a new "gold rush" in Fortitude. Every faction is desperate to locate and control these sites, and the promise of their unique treasures is the single greatest driver for the perilous expeditions that are posted daily on the Adventurer's Board.
