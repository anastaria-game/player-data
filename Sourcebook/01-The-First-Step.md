# The First Step

The Arbiters on the Loom called it a choice. "A lifetime in the penitentiary of the Accord, or a new beginning in Anastaria." Some choice. A cage of sterile stone or a cage of savage wilderness. I chose the one I hadn't seen yet.

The Gate didn't look like much from our side. Just a shimmering, heat-haze curtain hanging in the air of a grey, featureless room. No grand archway, no runes, just a silent tear in the world. The Arbiter, his face bored and unsympathetic, gestured with his thumb. "Next."

I took a breath of the clean, recycled air of the Loom one last time and stepped through.

It wasn't like walking through a door. It was like being plunged into an ocean. The silence of the Loom was shattered by an omnipresent *hum*—an acoustic and psychic phenomenon all at once. It was a sound I could just perceive at the edge of my hearing, a deep, resonant tone, but it was also a light pressure on my mind, a vibration in my teeth and bones that was almost unnoticeable until I focused on it. It was the feeling of a billion things living and dying all at once. The air, thick and wet, smelled of alien blossoms, damp earth, and a sharp, ozone tang like a lightning strike. My ordered, predictable world was gone.

I stumbled forward onto a stone platform, blinking against the strange, perpetual twilight. There was no sun. Instead, a colossal gas giant, a swirling marble of green and violet, hung in the sky like a baleful eye. It cast no warmth, only a soft, eerie glow over the city that sprawled before me.

Fortitude. It sat atop a massive, flat-topped butte, a scar of civilization on a world that didn't want it. In the center, a colossal tower of brass and crystal hummed in time with the world, its light a steady, reassuring pulse of white against the alien sky. Weir's Lantern. I could feel its order pushing back against the chaos, a tiny island of "sane" in a sea of "other."

Around the Lantern, the buildings were of stone and brick, orderly and proud—the Founder's Ring, they called it. But beyond that, stretching to a formidable wall of sharpened logs and giant, salvaged bones, was the real city. The Shambles. A chaotic maze of rough-hewn timber, patched with the chitinous plates of monstrous creatures. It was a desperate, sprawling mess, and it was my new home.

A pair of Wardens, their armor a mix of steel and dark insect shell, watched my group of fellow Exiles with weary eyes. They didn't see criminals or dissidents. They saw fresh meat. A Wyldborn kid with moss-green streaks in his hair leaned against a post, chewing on a piece of jerky, his gaze a mixture of pity and contempt for us newcomers who didn't yet know the taste of Zephyr-Hare or the sound a Skymantid makes before it dives.

I looked from the comforting, orderly light of the Lantern to the savage, unknown wilderness visible beyond the walls. The Arbiters had called this a new beginning. Standing there, with the hum of the Wyld in my ears and the taste of ozone on my tongue, I knew they were wrong. This wasn't a beginning. This was the first day of survival.
