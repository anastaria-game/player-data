# World Summary

Everything you need to know to get started.

## The World You Left

Your story begins with a choice, but for most, it was a choice made for them. The world you came from, the Loom, has known a thousand years of peace under the Great Accord. It is a world of order, stability, and rigid tradition. But with great safety comes great stagnation. There are no great wars to fight, no ancient evils to vanquish, and little room for those who don't fit in.

Forty-six years ago, a gate was opened to Anastaria, and the governments of the Loom found a perfect solution for their malcontents. It has become a dumping ground for criminals, political dissidents, disgraced nobles, and anyone whose ambition or wanderlust is deemed a threat to the quiet order. While it is not impossible for one to volunteer for a life on this new frontier—perhaps a seventh son with no inheritance seeking glory, or a scholar hungry for new discoveries—the vast majority who pass through the gate do so with a one-way ticket, exiled to a world they know nothing about.

## The World You've Found

Anastaria is a world of savage, beautiful chaos. Whether by birth or by banishment, your home is *Fortitude*, the only bastion of civilization, a frontier city of roughly fifteen thousand souls built atop a massive stone butte. It is a city of luxury, squalor, salvaged parts, and simmering tensions, a place where desperate survivors from a hundred different cultures must learn to coexist. Fortitude is the only thing standing between you and the *Wyld*.

The Wyld is not just a wilderness; it is a different reality. A world of pure, untamed life, hostile to the ordered nature of the Loom. For an Exile, it is a land of predatory plants and alien monsters, where the laws of nature themselves seem to fray at the edges, and the feeling of being an unwelcome intruder is constant. For the Wyldborn, this is simply the backyard you were told never to play in, its dangers as familiar and respected as a hot stove. In either case, it is a place that offers combat and social encounters, challenges of exploration, and the promise of survival against all odds.

This is the world you've been born into or cast into. A single city of order surrounded by a world of beautiful, savage chaos. Your story begins on the Adventurer's Board in 'The Last Light' tavern, where fortune and an early grave are posted in equal measure.
