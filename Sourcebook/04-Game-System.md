# The Game System: Draw Steel

Our campaign will be using the rules from the tabletop roleplaying game *Draw Steel* by MCDM Productions with some, light modifications. It is a system designed for heroic, action-oriented stories, with a focus on tactical choices and narrative outcomes. While we will use its core principles, it's important to understand its unique approach to resolving challenges.

## Where to Find the Game

Draw Steel is a robust and exciting system, and you are highly encouraged to check out the official resources to learn more, but we have a modified version of the SRD available for new players.
