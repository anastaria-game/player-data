# Factions of Fortitude

The city is a pressure cooker of conflicting interests, dominated by five major factions.

## The Combine {#the-combine}

**Leader:** Director Kaelen Valerius

**Description:** A ruthless, Loom-backed resource-extraction guild focused solely on profit. They see Anastaria as a treasure chest to be cracked open, funding expeditions and hiring mercenaries for high-paying, morally ambiguous work.

## The Wardens {#the-wardens}

**Leader:** Lord-Commander Gretta

**Description:** The underfunded military and law enforcement of Fortitude. Tasked with keeping order and protecting the city from the horrors outside its walls, they are a source of righteous quests like hunting dangerous beasts or finding lost patrols.

## The Seekers {#the-seekers}

**Leader:** Elder Zale (de facto)

**Description:** An affiliation of scholars, mystics, and druids who wish to understand and coexist with the Wyld. They offer quests of discovery, exploration, and knowledge, seeking harmony over conflict.

## The Cog & Covenant {#cog-n-covenant}

**Leader:** Master Artificer Bartholomew Weir

**Description:** The indispensable and elite guild of mages and artificers who maintain Weir's Lantern. They are the primary source for magical goods and highly technical, dangerous quests focused on innovation and maintenance.

## The Tatter-Web {#the-tatter-web}

**Leader:** Silas Rook

**Description:** A powerful thieves' guild and black market operating from the shadows of the Shambles. They control the city's underworld and are patrons for all manner of illicit jobs, from smuggling to espionage.
