# Campaign Style: A West Marches Campaign

Anastaria is designed as a **West Marches** style campaign. This is a player-driven sandbox where the story is created by your choices and explorations.

## Core Principles:

* **No Set Party:** There is no single, fixed group of adventurers. Players will form their own parties in Fortitude before each session.
* **No Linear Plot:** The world is a sandbox. The Director does not drive a narrative; instead, the story is the chronicle of the players' discoveries, successes, and failures.
* **Player-Driven Goals:** Players decide what they want to explore or achieve. They might choose a quest from the Adventurer's Board, investigate a rumor, or simply strike out to map a new part of the wilderness.
* **Fortitude is Home Base:** The city of Fortitude is the only safe place. All adventures begin and end there. Downtime between sessions occurs within the city walls. You may eventually be able to carve out your own, secure place in the Wyld, but to start - its Fortitude.
