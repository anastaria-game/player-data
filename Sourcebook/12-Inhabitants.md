# Children of the Wyld

A bestiary of the strange and hostile creatures native to Anastaria.

## The T'choac (The Claws of the Wyld)

The dominant intelligent species of Anastaria.

* **Appearance:** The T'choac are humanoid insectoids whose chitin is not a single color, but a mottled camouflage of greens (ranging from pale moss to deep olive) and browns (from dusty khaki to rich chocolate), often highlighted with streaks of ochre and black. This allows them to blend seamlessly into the Anastarian wilds. Their society is divided into specialized castes.
  + **T'choac Warriors:** The most common caste, Warriors stand slightly taller than a human. They are lithe but powerful, with two primary arms ending in three-fingered, razor-sharp talons, and a pair of smaller, vestigial arms on their chest used for fine manipulation. Their heads are triangular, with large, multifaceted black eyes and constantly twitching antennae.
  + **T'choac Titans:** The hulking brutes of T'choac society, standing nearly eight feet tall and twice as broad as a human. They possess four massive, fully-functional arms, each capable of crushing rock or wielding heavy weapons. Their chitin is thicker, often scarred, and tends toward the darker brown and black patterns.
  + **T'choac Striders:** The smallest and most nimble caste, with a slighter frame than a Warrior. Their most striking feature is a pair of iridescent, insectoid wings folded against their backs. While not capable of sustained flight, these wings allow them to glide for long distances and make incredible leaps, making them perfect scouts and aerial skirmishers. Their chitin is typically lighter, favoring mossy greens and khaki.
* **Society:** Individualistic, forming complex colonies. They communicate intellectually through body language and emotionally through powerful pheromones that can enforce a temporary group unity.
* **Stance on Fortitude:** Varies by proximity. Nearby colonies see the settlers as an existential threat; distant colonies view them as a mere pest.

**Whispers in the Shambles:** "Heard a Seeker sayin' some T'choac tribes use Razorgrass to make blades sharp enough to cut through steel. Don't believe it myself."

## Grave-Maw

Lumbering through the swamps and petrified forests of the Penumbra, the Grave-Maw is less a creature and more a living bulldozer. Its territorial aggression is legendary among the people of Fortitude, and the sound of its grinding maw is often the only warning before a charge that can shatter bone and steel alike.

* **Appearance:** Resembling a monstrous, six-legged armadillo, the Grave-Maw stands nearly ten feet at the shoulder. Its body is covered in thick, interlocking plates of dark grey chitin, scarred and worn from a life of pushing through petrified wood. Its head is almost all maw, a wide, bone-white grinder capable of pulverizing stone. Its small, black eyes are set deep within its armored skull, glowing with a dull, hostile intelligence.
* **Behavior:** Wild Grave-Maws are extremely territorial and will charge any perceived threat without warning, making them a significant environmental hazard. They are placid only when left undisturbed in their muddy wallows.
* **Role in the Ecosystem:** Its immense strength and durable hide make it a formidable challenge for any predator. Some T'choac tribes have managed to domesticate these beasts, a testament to their own power and skill, using them to haul immense loads or as living siege engines.

**Whispers in the Shambles:** "[The Combine](09-Factions.md#the-combine) tried to capture a wild Grave-maw last month. The beast tore through two of their armored carts before it escaped. Said the ground shook when it charged."

## Skymantids

The true terror of the Anastarian skies, Skymantids are the embodiment of aerial death. Their screeching calls echo through the twilight, a signal that the hunt has begun. Prospectors and trappers fear their sudden, silent dives more than almost any other threat in the Penumbra, as a pack can descend and eviscerate a target in seconds.

* **Appearance:** A Skymantid's body is a meter-long assembly of sharp angles and iridescent chitin, ranging in color from oil-slick black to deep violet. Its two hind legs are for gripping, while its two primary forelimbs are elongated, serrated scythes. Its head is a triangular wedge dominated by multifaceted black eyes and twitching antennae that constantly taste the air for the scent of magic. Its wings, when unfurled, are beautiful but deadly, catching the dim light like stained glass shards.
* **Behavior:** Animal-level intelligence. While a single Skymantid can be handled by a capable individual, they are rarely found alone, typically hunting in packs of 4-6 that use speed and numbers to overwhelm prey. They are particularly drawn to the "taste" of Loom-based magic being cast.
* **Role in the Ecosystem:** A keystone predator that is a vital food source for Fortitude, as most of the creature is edible, high in protein, and a key ingredient in the city's infamous "Cutter Stew." Their chitin is also used for tools and light armor.
* **The Resonance Gland:** Skymantids possess a small, crystalline organ near their heart that pulses with chaotic energy. This gland can be harvested and used as a low-grade, albeit volatile and inefficient, fuel source for Weir's Lantern.

**Whispers in the Shambles:** "They say there's a Matriarch out there, big as a house. Her gland is supposed to burn as bright as a star. [The Combine](09-Factions.md#the-combine)'s offering a fortune for its location."

## Zephyr-Hare

A constant, twitching presence in the grasslands of the Threshold, the Zephyr-Hare is a creature of pure nervous energy. Its existence is a perpetual act of evasion, a series of explosive leaps to escape the myriad predators that hunt it. For the residents of Fortitude, its foul taste is a bitter reminder of the Wyld's alien nature, where even the most seemingly harmless creatures are fundamentally wrong.

* **Appearance:** The Zephyr-Hare combines mammalian and insectoid features in an unsettling blend. Its body is covered in a thick, mossy-green fur, but this fur grows directly from a segmented, chitinous shell. It has six legs; four small forelegs for scurrying and two massive, heavily-muscled hind legs that are coiled like springs. Its rabbit-like head has long, sensitive antennae instead of ears, and its large, black eyes offer a wide, panoramic view of its surroundings.
* **Behavior:** Extremely skittish, traveling in large, fast-moving flocks. Their primary defense is their explosive jumping ability, launching themselves great distances to evade predators.
* **Role in the Ecosystem:** The primary food source for Skymantids and other mid-level predators. While technically edible, their meat is notoriously foul-tasting, making them a food source of last resort for the people of Fortitude.

**Whispers in the Shambles:** "Saw a Zephyr-Hare clear a fifty-foot chasm in a single bound. Looked like a green blur. Then a Skymantid snatched it right out of the air mid-jump."

## Grove-Mites

Grove-Mites are not born; they are grown. They are the Wyld's answer to a cancer, a mindless, swarming plague that erupts from the earth with a single, terrifying purpose: to consume, spread, and overwhelm. The sight of their glowing caps bobbing in the darkness is a sign that the very ground has become an enemy.

* **Appearance:** A Grove-Mite stands barely three feet tall, its body a lumpy, vaguely humanoid shape composed of pale, rubbery mycelium. It has no discernible face, only a glowing, capped mushroom where its head should be, which pulses with a soft, bioluminescent light. Its limbs are spindly and weak-looking, ending in crude, finger-like appendages. When it moves, it leaves a faint trail of slime and spores.
* **Behavior:** Mindless extensions of a parent fungal colony. They exist only to consume organic matter and spread spores. When killed, they burst in a potentially infectious cloud.

**Whispers in the Shambles:** "My cousin took a job clearin' a mite nest. Came back with a cough that glows in the dark. The Wardens took him away last night."

## The Wilted

The most profound horror for the Loom-born is the fate that awaits their dead. The Wilted are a perversion of life, a walking testament to the Wyld's rejection of ordered matter. They are the ghosts of Fortitude's failures, shambling through the Penumbra, forever drawn to the life they can no longer possess.

* **Appearance:** A Wilted is the desiccated corpse of a human, elf, or other Loom-born creature, its skin tight like yellowed parchment over bone. Its body is a garden for alien life; thick, phosphorescent moss covers it in patches, and strange, shelf-like fungi sprout from its back and shoulders. Its eyes are gone, replaced by hollow sockets from which a faint, cold light emanates. Its movements are stiff and jerky, a puppet pulled by unseen strings.
* **Behavior:** Mindless automatons drawn to the order of Loom-born life and magic, which they instinctively seek to extinguish.

**Whispers in the Shambles:** "They say a Wilted still has memories. Saw one once, just standin' there, starin' at a trinket it must've dropped when it was alive. Creepiest thing I ever saw."

## Crones

Some forces are universal. The Crones of Anastaria are a testament to this, embodying the same ancient, cunning malice as their Loom-born cousins. They are the whispers in the dark woods, the faces in the gnarled trees, and the architects of despair. They are not merely monsters; they are intelligent, malevolent forces of nature who see mortals as playthings in their long, cruel games.

* **Appearance:** No two Crones look exactly alike, as their forms warp to match their corrupted territories. A bog crone may have skin like slick, green mud and hair of tangled reeds, while a stone crone from the high crags might have grey, cracked skin and fingers like jagged shards of rock. All share the same gaunt, withered frame, long, spindly limbs, and eyes that glitter with ancient, predatory intelligence. They are often masters of disguise, using illusions to appear as helpless old women or beautiful youths to lure in their prey.
* **Behavior:** Highly intelligent, malicious, and territorial schemers. They practice primal Wyld magic and delight in making corrupting bargains.

**Whispers in the Shambles:** "Old Man Hemlock swore he made a deal with a Crone for a perfect harvest. Got his harvest, but his scarecrows started moving on their own a week later. Now he just drinks."

## Kaotikoi

In the chaotic energies near the edge of the Deep Wyld, where the laws of reality are frayed, the Kaotikoi thrive. They are not simply creatures; they are living embodiments of entropy, walking avatars of chaos. Their presence is a blight on order, and their goal is not to kill, but to convert, spreading their chaotic nature like a plague until all is as beautifully, horribly random as they are.

* **Appearance:** A Kaotikoi stands as tall as a man, a bipedal amphibian whose frog-like body is in a constant state of flux. Its skin writhes with shifting colors and patterns, like oil on water. Its form is unstable; one moment it may have two eyes, the next three, before one melts back into its flesh. Its limbs might elongate or retract, and small, useless appendages might sprout and wither in seconds. The only constant is its wide, toothy maw, and the air of maddening randomness that surrounds it.
* **Behavior:** Living embodiments of entropy. They are driven to spread chaos and can implant victims with a 'chaos tadpole' that transforms the host into a new Kaotikoi. Tadpoles shed during combat that do not find a host quickly become inert, hardening into a porous, rock-like state resembling oddly formed pumice stone. They can remain dormant in this state for years, but will reactivate if warmed to near body temperature (e.g., by a nearby campfire), at which point they will aggressively seek the nearest living host.

**Whispers in the Shambles:** "[The Combine](09-Factions.md#the-combine) lost a whole prospecting team a month back. One guy made it back, screaming about 'frogs that sang reality apart.' He's in the [Cog & Covenant](09-Factions.md#cog-n-covenant)'s custody now. They ain't lettin' anyone see him."
