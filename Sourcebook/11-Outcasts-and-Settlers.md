# Outcasts and Settlers

The hardy souls who live beyond the Bulwark.

Not everyone who comes to Anastaria chooses to live within the crowded, muddy walls of Fortitude. A slow but steady trickle of souls have opted for the dangerous freedom of the Penumbra over the stifling safety of the city. These are the grizzled prospectors searching for the next big score, the reclusive trappers who know the wilds better than any Warden, the independent Seekers who wish to live in harmony with the Wyld, and the hedge witches who prefer the company of strange plants to people. They are rugged, self-reliant, and often deeply paranoid—qualities essential for survival on the frontier.

## "Glimmer" Jax, The Prospector

A wiry, sun-scorched human man whose eyes are in constant motion, Jax is a common, if unsettling, sight in the Penumbra. He is utterly obsessed with finding the "motherlode" of Glimmer-Quartz and is known for his paranoid ramblings about T'choac spies and unseen watchers. He lives in a series of heavily fortified, temporary camps, moving his claim every few weeks. He's always looking to hire guards, but his contracts rarely last long due to his erratic behavior.

## Old Man Fitz, The Trapper

Deep in the forests along the Murky River lives a reclusive trapper known only as Fitz. He is a man of few words, preferring to let the quality of his pelts speak for themselves. Warden patrols and independent traders know the location of his well-hidden lean-to, a common place to trade high-quality, cured hides for simple goods like salt, tools, and ale. Fitz is not much for conversation and seems to value his solitude above all else.

## The Silent Man of the Petrified Forest

Travelers in the Petrified Forest sometimes speak of a lone, Exiled Wode Elf who lives in a hollowed-out stone tree. He is known as the Silent Man, for he has never been heard to speak, communicating only through a series of simple, elegant hand gestures. He is a master of camouflage and is believed to be a Seeker who has fully embraced the Wyld. He avoids direct contact, but has been known to leave cryptic trail markers—a carefully placed feather, a circle of stones—that can warn of a nearby predator or, some say, lead to a hidden Vanhir ruin.

## The Petrified Man

In a quiet meadow in the Threshold, just off the main road, stands a man in what appears to be quiet contemplation, eyes closed, hands at his sides in repose. On closer examination, however, he is exactly what all travelers of the Wyld fear the most—gone. His entire body has been transformed into a seamless statue of petrified wood, his expression serene, his clothes and gear rendered in perfect, lifeless detail. He's been in this meadow, in this same position, for at least twenty years. No one alive knows his name, but all who travel the northern road know of him and use him as a grim landmark and a sobering reminder of the Wyld's patient, creeping power.

## Meg Hollowtree, The Witch of the Swamp

On the far side of the Petrified Forest, at the edge of a murky swamp, lives a reclusive woman known as Meg Hollowtree. To the few Warden patrols who interact with her, she is an eccentric elven witch, an Exile who prefers the solitude of the wilds to the chaos of the city. She is a valuable, if unsettling, source of rare herbs and high-quality chitin, which she trades for simple tools and news from Fortitude. The Wardens who deal with her report that while her goods are reliable, there is something odd about her that makes them eager to conclude their business and leave.
