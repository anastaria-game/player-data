# The City of Fortitude

## The Bastion Butte

The arrival of the Gate was a cataclysmic event of spatial transference. It didn't just open a door; it obliterated a five-mile-diameter half-dome of the Wyld. The result was the instantaneous creation of a massive, perfectly flat-topped butte, 50 feet above the surrounding plains, atomized down to solid bedrock. Locals call it the Bastion Butte or "The Butte". This single geological feature, providing a natural fortress against the hostile wilds, is the only reason the colony survived its early years. The city, its gardens, and its defenses are all contained within this plateau.

## The Gate Surround

The very center of Fortitude is the Gate Surround, a three hundred foot diameter clear area encompassing 

### The Gate

The gate itself is a ten foot wide, twenty foot tall pillar of purple flame.  Most avoid the immediate area around the gate as exiles pass through without warning, often very rapidly and occasionally accompanied by magical or mundane projectiles.

### The Glimmerflow Spring

The arrival of the Gate also fractured a deep, underground aquifer, creating a permanent, clean water source that bubbles up in a cavern near the center of the butte—The Glimmerflow Spring. This spring is the city's lifeblood, providing an endless supply of fresh water and making long-term survival possible.

### Weir's Lantern

The lantern itself is a promenent feature of the area as the primary tower raises up forty feet in the air, the tallest structure in Fortitude.  At the top, the lantern itself sets the clock - a cool blue glow during the day and a warm red ember at night.  Occupied around the clock by mages from [Cog & Covenant](09-Factions.md#cog-n-covenant) and guarded by [The Wardens](09-Factions.md#the-wardens).

## The Districts of Fortitude

Over 46 years, the settlement has developed in distinct rings, a perfect reflection of its history and needs:

* **The Founders' Ring (Inner Core):** The oldest part of the city, built during the first two decades by wealthy wizard enclaves and well-funded expeditions. The architecture is sturdy, well-made brick and stone—small manors, libraries, grand inns, and guildhalls. This is the seat of power, home to the Cog & Covenant's spire, the Combine's immaculate headquarters, and the residences of the city's elite.

* **The Shambles (Middle Ring):** The sprawling, chaotic district that makes up the bulk of the city. This area grew after the "dumping ground" policy began. The buildings here are made of cheaper wood from Threshold forests, salvaged chitin plates, and wattle-and-daub. It's a maze of muddy streets, crowded tenements, noisy workshops, and rowdy taverns. This is the true heart of Fortitude's populace of roughly fifteen thousand souls.

* **The Garden Ring (Outer Ring):** The vital agricultural heart of Fortitude. This wide ring of land between the Shambles and the Bulwark is dedicated to growing food. Managed by the pragmatic expertise of the Seekers, these fields and greenhouses produce the hardy, Loom-native crops that sustain the city. The entire district is enclosed by a 20-foot-high wooden palisade, separating it from the Shambles. Passage between the districts is restricted to four main corridors at the cardinal directions, each heavily guarded by the Wardens.

* **The Bulwark and Kill-Zone (The Wall)** The outer protective layer that surrounds and fortifies Fortitude.

## Founder's Ring

The oldest and most powerful district in Fortitude, characterized by its well-made brick and stone architecture. This is the seat of power, home to the city's elite.

### Weir's Lantern

The literal and figurative center of Fortitude. The Lantern is a towering, 100-foot-tall spire of interlocking brass rings, humming crystals, and glowing conduits that stands in the central plaza of the Founder's Ring. Its constant, low hum is the city's heartbeat, and its light is the only thing holding back the Wyld. Access is restricted to authorized members of the Cog & Covenant, and it is heavily guarded at all times.

### The Glimmerflow Spring

Accessible via a wide, torch-lit staircase that descends from the main plaza, the Glimmerflow Spring is the city's primary source of fresh water and is guarded around the clock by at least six Wardens. The spring bubbles up from the fractured bedrock into a large, crystal-clear pool within a natural cavern. The cavern is illuminated not by torches, but by an irregular patchwork of bioluminescent moss that covers the upper third of the ceiling, casting a soft, shifting glow of blue and green light upon the water below. This is a public space, constantly busy with citizens collecting water, and a common, neutral ground for quiet conversations away from the prying ears of the city's main thoroughfares.

### The Combine Spire

A stark, modern tower of black glass and polished steel that seems utterly alien even amongst the brickwork of the Founder's Ring. This is the headquarters of [The Combine](09-Factions.md#the-combine) in Anastaria. It is a place of business, where adventurers go to receive high-paying contracts from Director Valerius and his staff. The building is immaculately clean and ruthlessly efficient, a sterile slice of the Loom's corporate culture.

### The Bastion Barracks

A large, fortified compound that serves as the headquarters for [The Wardens](09-Factions.md#the-wardens). It is a grim, functional place, constantly bustling with patrols coming and going. The barracks contain the city's armory, a training yard, and the office of Lord-Commander Gretta. It is a place of order and discipline in a city that often has neither.

### The Weirwood Athenaeum

The public library of the [Cog & Covenant](09-Factions.md#cog-n-covenant), a grand stone building filled with towering shelves of books salvaged from the Loom or painstakingly copied by scribes. It is a quiet, dusty repository of knowledge, overseen by the cantankerous Archivist Titus. It is one of the few places in Fortitude where one can find reliable information, provided they can navigate the labyrinthine rules of its keeper.

### The Gilded Cage

An impeccably clean and astronomically expensive inn run by the Exiled noblewoman, Lady Evandra. It is an island of Loom-born civility, catering exclusively to the city's elite—faction leaders, wealthy merchants, and the occasional high-rolling adventurer. The Gilded Cage is known as a neutral ground where sensitive deals are made, and its reputation is fiercely protected by its proprietor.

### The Sanctuary of the Adamant

A fortified temple and training ground run by the zealously devout warrior-priest, Vicar Thrace. The Sanctuary preaches a doctrine of righteous fury against the "unholy chaos" of the Wyld. It is a place of harsh martial training, fervent prayer, and unwavering certainty, offering blessings of battle to those who join Thrace's crusade.

## The Shambles

The sprawling, chaotic district that makes up the bulk of the city. A maze of muddy streets, crowded tenements, and noisy workshops, this is the true heart of Fortitude's populace, where the Wyldborn and newly Exiled live and work side-by-side.

### The Last Light

A large, rambling tavern that is the undisputed social hub of the Shambles. It's loud, crowded, and smells of spilled ale, strange stew, and wet chitin. Run by the charismatic publican Finn, it is the best place to hear the city's most recent gossip. At its center is the Adventurer's Board, a massive, cork-covered wall where all the factions post public requests for aid, making it the primary source of quests in Fortitude.

### The Skittering Shield

The smithy of the Wyldborn dwarf Boric. The air here is thick with the acrid smell of burning resin and grinding chitin. Boric doesn't work with metal, but is a master of crafting armor, shields, and weapons from the carapaces of Anastaria's creatures. His work is brutally functional, surprisingly durable, and a common sight among Warden patrols and seasoned adventurers.

### The Seekers' Enclave

Hidden away in a quiet corner of the Shambles, [The Seekers](09-Factions.md#the-seekers)' main enclave is not a public space. It is a collection of greenhouses, libraries, and simple living quarters where scholars and druids study the Wyld in peace. While their public-facing market stalls are in the Market Square and Founder's Ring, this is the true heart of their faction, where players might be invited if they earn the deep trust of Elder Zale or his followers.

### The Root Cellar

A small, cluttered shop packed with dried herbs, strange fungi, and bubbling alchemical concoctions. Run by the quiet herbalist Elara, it is the primary source of healing potions and antitoxins in the Shambles. Elara is a known Seeker sympathizer, and often reserves her best stock for those she trusts to use it wisely. On one of the scorched support timbers salvaged from an old brewery, a carving reads: "Pyre of '38. Never forget."

### The Mended Cog

Next door to the Root Cellar is the workshop of Cora. Her shop is a place of quiet, methodical work, offering repairs for metal goods that Boric won't touch, identification of strange Vanhir trinkets, and the crafting of clever, low-level enchanted items for the common folk.

### The Rookery

One of several tenements owned by the sharp-tongued landlord, Marta. The Rookery is a tall, rickety wooden building that has become the default starting residence for most newly-arrived adventurers. The rooms are cheap, the walls are thin, and the landlord knows everyone's business, making it a hotbed of gossip and low-level intrigue.

### The Sojourn

A small, perpetually crowded infirmary run by the compassionate but weary cleric, Brother Callum. It is a place of quiet suffering and desperate hope, offering healing to all who need it. Its resources are always stretched to the breaking point, and Callum often relies on adventurers to help him acquire rare alchemical ingredients from the Wyld.

## The Outer Rings

The agricultural and defensive districts of Fortitude.

Surrounding the residential Shambles are the rings of land dedicated to sustaining and protecting the city. This is where the city's food is grown and where its last line of defense stands against the Wyld.

### The Garden Ring

The vital agricultural heart of Fortitude. This wide ring of land between the Shambles and the Bulwark is dedicated to growing food. Managed by the pragmatic expertise of the Seekers, these fields and greenhouses produce the hardy, Loom-native crops that sustain the city. The entire district is enclosed by a 20-foot-high wooden palisade, separating it from the Shambles. Passage between the districts is restricted to four main corridors at the cardinal directions, each heavily guarded by the Wardens.

### The Bulwark and the Kill-Zone

The city's outermost defense is a two-tiered system, built on the flat plains of the butte surrounding the Garden Ring.

* **The Bulwark:** The city's outer wall is a grim, functional testament to decades of desperation. It is not a single, elegant structure, but a hodgepodge of brutalist construction. The 40-foot-high wall has a base of rough-hewn stone quarried directly from the butte, a middle layer of massive, petrified wood logs dragged from the Penumbra, and a parapet topped with sharpened stakes and jagged shards of salvaged monster chitin. Warden towers, stark and ugly, are placed at regular intervals. The Bulwark is pierced by four massive gates at the cardinal directions. Given the wall's massive 25-mile circumference, constant foot patrols are impossible. Instead, the Wardens focus their manpower on heavily guarding these gates and the corridors between the city districts, relying on tower sentries to watch the vast stretches in between.

* **The Kill-Zone:** The half-mile expanse of flat, barren ground between the Garden Ring and the Bulwark. This no-man's-land is deliberately kept clear of all vegetation and cover by Warden patrols. It is a churned field of mud and gravel, dotted with simple defensive emplacements: fields of caltrops made from sharpened bones, deep ditches, and rows of sharpened stakes. It serves as the city's killing field, a place where any creature that manages to breach the outer wall can be cut down by archers with nowhere to hide.

### The North Gate Market Square

While all four gates see traffic, the North Gate is by far the busiest, as it opens onto the main, well-trodden road leading to the primary logging areas in the Threshold. As a result, a wide, muddy market square has formed in the plaza just inside this gate, serving as the city's primary commercial hub for adventurers and frontiersmen.

### The Gutter Market

The chaotic, open-air centerpiece of the market square. This is the primary hub for adventurers and trappers to offload their hauls from the Penumbra, filled with the smells of strange meat, chitin dust, and alchemical reagents. Here, players can sell monster parts, purchase raw materials, and hear the most recent rumors from the frontier. While under the watchful eye of the Wardens, it is also known that [The Tatter-Web](09-Factions.md#the-tatter-web)'s fences operate openly here.

### The Threshold Exchange

A clean, well-appointed shop standing in stark contrast to the mud of the Gutter Market. Run by the impossibly charming Aris Thorne, the Exchange is the only place in Fortitude that deals in high-end adventuring gear from the Loom and buys rare Vanhir artifacts. They offer the best prices for those with valuable goods to sell, making it a natural destination for successful adventurers.

### The Seekers' Market Stalls

While their main enclave is a private affair in the Shambles, [The Seekers](09-Factions.md#the-seekers)' public face is their market stalls. Their largest stall is in the Gutter Market, where they sell produce from the Garden Ring, trade rare herbs, and offer guides and maps for the Penumbra. They also maintain a smaller, much more expensive stall just outside the Founder's Ring for nobles and merchants who don't wish to walk to the gate to buy their lettuce.
