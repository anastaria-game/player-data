# Overland Travel

This document outlines the special rules for survival and exploration in the West Marches setting of Anastaria. These rules are additions and modifications to the core **Draw Steel** system.

## Game Day

Each 24 hour period of the game is a "day".  The overland travel is broken into phases:

* Planning
* Travel
  * Exploration Activities (if any)
* Camp
  * Watches

## Planning

At the beginning of the day the party makes a Navigation check: An **Reason** test using the **Navigate** skill (group roll with players assisting with relevant skills), you receive a bonus for each successful **Reconnoiter** check from the previous day and any map or guide you have with you (depends on the map/guide).

* **Failure:** Wrong direction! You lose **1d4** hours of travel.
* **Success with a Consequence:**&#x20;
* **Success:** A success, no penalty to your movement.
* **Success with a Reward:** You found a path or shortcut, two extra hours of travel time available.

## Hex-Based Travel

Overland travel is conducted on a map of 3-mile hexes. The time it takes to travel through a hex depends on the terrain type, as shown in the table below. A standard day of travel is considered to be 8 hours. Any time remaining in the day can be spent on other activities within the hex.

| Terrain Type       | Time / Hex | Make Camp Difficulty |
| ------------------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Road               | 1 hour     | Easy                 |
| Grassland / Plains | 2 hours    | Easy                 |
| Forest / Desert    | 3 hours    | Medium               |
| Wetlands / Marsh   | 4 hours    | Medium               |
| Mountains          | 1 day      | Hard                 |

## Exploration Activities

The party may perform one of the following optional actions per character, per hex, per day. These actions are performed during travel and do not consume additional time unless noted otherwise. For example, a character could Forage in the hex where the party starts the day, and then after traveling to a new hex, Hunt in that new hex.

* **Forage**: A player makes an **Intuition** test using the **Nature** skill to find food, water, or firewood. The check difficulty is dependent on the terrain (Easy for Forest/Wetlands, Medium for Grassland, Hard for Roads/Mountains). A successful check grants **1d6** units of food or water (player's choice) or a single unit of firewood. A failure with a consequence costs an additional 1 hour of travel time.
* **Hunt:** A player makes an **Agility** test using the **Track** skill to find game. A successful check grants **4d6** units of food. A failure with a consequence costs an additional 1d6 hours of travel time. Hunting is a Normal check in most hexes, a Difficult check on Mountain and Desert, and impossible on a Road.
* **Reconnoiter:** A player makes an **Intuition** check.  A map or guide can provide a bonus. A successful check reveals a hidden shortcut or landmark in the hex, granting a **+2 bonus** to the next day's navigation check. A failure costs 1 hour of travel time as the player gets momentarily lost.  Reconnoiter cannot be performed in a Road hex.

## Travel Pace

The party's travel pace is determined by the total number of hours they spend traveling per day. This pace affects their performance the following day and during the night's watch.

* **Cautious Pace (4-6 hours):** This grants a double edge to that evening's _Camp Check_ and a **+2 bonus** on the _Encounter Checks_ that night.
* **Conservative Pace (6-7 hours):** This grants an edge to that evening's _Camp Check_ and a **+1 bonus** on the _Encounter Checks_ that night.
* **Normal Pace (8 hours):** No modifiers.
* **Marching Pace (9-10 hours):** This applies a bane to that evening's _Camp Check_ and a **-1 penalty** on the _Encounter Checks_ that night.
* **Forced March (11+ hours):** This applies a double bane to that evening's _Camp Check_ a **-2 penalty** on the _Encounter Checks_ that night.

## Rest & Camping

The core rest and recovery mechanics have been modified to reflect the dangers of the wilderness.

If outside of a secure location, camping is the only rest alternative.  Spending a time in the wilderness is dangerous.  Adventurers are advised to plan their route, keep an eye on their supplies and manage their stamina and time cautiously.

All party members who are _not_ on watch gain _one_ recovery per watch. A character on watch for a given watch period is awake and therefore gains no recoveries during that period.

### Make Camp Check

At the end of a travel period, each member of the party consumes one unit of food and water.  If any member is unable to consume both one food and one water, they lose two recoveries.  After, the party makes a single **Make Camp** check to determine the quality of their campsite for the night.

* **Check:** An **Intuition** check (group roll with other players assisting with relevant skills). The difficulty is based on the hex's terrain.
* **Failure (≤11):** A poor camp is made. Apply a **-2 penalty** to each nightly Encounter Check.
* **Success (12-16):** A secure camp is made. No bonus on the nightly Encounter Checks.
* **Success with a Reward (17+):** An exceptionally secure camp is made. Grant a **+2 bonus** to each nightly Encounter Check.

### Per-Watch Random Encounters

For each 4-hour watch period, the player on watch makes a single **Encounter Check** to determine the events of the night. The difficulty is based on the hex's terrain and modified:

* Travel Pace, between a **-2 penalty** and a **+2 bonus**

* The **Make Camp** check, between a **-2 penalty** and a **+2 bonus**

* Using a unit of firewood gives a **+6 bonus** that can be divided out over the next three watches as the party wishes. You could use the entire bonus on one watch, divide it evenly or some other distribution.  If you have the wood, you an burn one unit per watch for a **+6 bonus** every watch!

* **Check:** An **Intuition** check by the player on watch. The difficulty is determined by the hex's terrain.

* **Outcome:**
  * **Failure:** The watch is surprised by an encounter of some kind. No party members gain any recoveries for this watch period.
  * **Success with a Consequence**: The watch catches a minor disturbance, e.g. one unit of food taken by a hungry critter.
  * **Success:**  The player on watch gains no recoveries for this watch period.
  * **Success with a Reward:** An uneventful watch. All party members, including the player on watch, gain an additional recovery.

## A Day in the Westwood

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine and damp earth. Before the party stood the jagged teeth of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, their intended destination. The four adventurers stood at the edge of the Westwood, a dense forest hex they had camped in the night before.

>*"Alright team, the pass into the mountains should be just north of this ridge. If we get a clean start, we can be through the foothills before nightfall," said Alaric, the human tactician and self-appointed navigator, unrolling a worn parchment map.*
>
>*"Less talking, more walking. The mountain isn't going to climb itself."*
>
>*"Patience, Ghorza," rumbled Borin Stonehand, a dwarf conduit whose calm demeanor was as solid as the rock he revered. "A rushed start is a false start. Let the man plan."*
>
>Finn, a quiet polder shadow, simply nodded, his eyes scanning the treeline, already half-merged with the morning shadows.

### Phase 1: Planning

Alaric took the lead on the day's **Navigation check**. It was a group roll, using his **Intuition**.

>*"Borin, you know stone and root better than any of us. Give me a hand here," Alaric said, gesturing to the map. Borin nodded, peering at the contours. "Aye. The land slopes that way. The streams should flow from the pass." Borin's player offered to assist, using his **Nature** skill.*
>
> The Director called for the roll. "It's an **Intuition** check. Your goal is the mountains, so the terrain is tricky. Go ahead."

Alaric's player rolled 2d10 and got an 8. He added his **Intuition** of +1 and Borin's assist with the **Nature** skill for a +2 bonus.

**Alaric's Roll:** 8 (dice) + 1 (Intuition) + 2 (Borin's Assist) = **11**.

> *"An 11," Alaric announced with a groan.*

According to the Overland Travel rules, a roll of 11 or lower on the Planning stage is a **Failure**. The party had lost their way. The Director rolled a d4 to determine the time lost. The result was a 3.

> "You spend the first three hours of daylight arguing over the map and following a promising trail that turns out to be a circle," the Director explained. "By the time you find your way back to your morning campsite, the sun is already high in the sky. You've lost three hours."
>
> *"Three hours! Wasted! By the time we reach the foothills, we'll be making camp in the dark. Perfect for whatever toothy things live up there."*
>
>*"She's right. Pushing into the mountains now is a fool's errand. We'd be exhausted and exposed." He looked around at the dense forest. "New plan. We've lost time, so let's turn it into an advantage. We're in a Forest hex. We'll spend the rest of the morning here securing resources, travel to the next Forest hex this afternoon, and do the same there. We'll make camp early, rested and well-fed, and be ready for the mountains tomorrow with no distractions."*

## Phase 2: Travel & Exploration

The party agreed to the new plan. They would perform Exploration Activities in their current hex, travel for 3 hours to the next hex, and then perform more activities there.

### Exploration in the Starting Hex

**Ghorza went to Hunt.** This was a **Medium Agility** test with the **Track** skill. Her roll of 15, with +2 Agility and +2 Track, totaled **19**.

> "A clean success with a reward! You find the tracks of a large stag and follow them with predatory focus. After a short chase, a single well-aimed throwing axe brings the beast down. You've secured enough food for the party for 4 days."
>
>*"Now *that's* a productive morning," she grunted.*

**Borin went to Forage for food.** An **Easy Intuition** test with **Nature**. His roll of 13, with +2 Intuition and +2 Nature, totaled **17**.

> "A success with a reward. You find a patch of rare, nutrient-rich mushrooms and a bush heavy with ironberries. You gather 5 units of food."
>
>*"The forest provides for those who respect it."*

**Finn went to Forage for water.** An **Easy Intuition** test with **Nature**. His roll of 12, with modifiers, totaled **15**.

> "Success. You locate a clear, fast-flowing stream and replenish everyone's waterskins. You gather 3 units of water."

**Alaric decided to Reconnoiter.** An **Intuition** check. His roll of 14, with his **Navigate** skill and Intuition, totaled **17**.

> "Another success with a reward! You discover an old game trail heading towards the mountain pass. This grants a **+2 bonus** to tomorrow's Navigation check."
>
>*"I've found our path for tomorrow. No more mistakes."*

### Travel 1 Forest Hex, 3 Hours

The party traveled to the adjacent Forest hex, a journey that took 3 hours. Their total travel for the day put them well within the **Cautious Pace**, which would grant them benefits later.

### Exploration in the New Hex

**Ghorza went to Forage for food.** An **Easy Intuition** check with **Nature**. Her roll of 10, with modifiers, totaled **12**.

> "Success. It's not as bountiful, but you find a patch of edible roots. You gather 2 units of food."

**Borin went to Forage for firewood.** An **Easy Intuition** check with **Nature**. His roll of 16 totaled **20**.

> "Success with a reward! You stumble upon an abandoned woodcutter's lean-to. You find a full unit of firewood, with enough stockpiled for two more nights."

**Finn decided to Reconnoiter.** An **Intuition** check. His roll of 13 totaled **16**.

> "Success! You spot a key landmark—a uniquely shaped stone spire—that perfectly matches Alaric's game trail. This confirms your route and grants another **+2 bonus** to tomorrow's Navigation check."

**Alaric went to Forage for water.** An **Easy Intuition** test with **Nature**. His roll of 15 totaled **18**.

> "Success with a reward. You find a small spring, the water exceptionally pure. You gather 6 units of water."

## Phase 3: Camp

With their activities complete, the party found a defensible clearing. Their 3 hours of travel put them in the **Cautious Pace** category, granting them a **double edge** on their **Make Camp** check.

This was a group **Medium Intuition** check. Alaric's roll of 16, with his +1 Intuition and the double edge, was bumped from a Tier 2 Success to a **Tier 3 Success with a Reward**.

> "Excellent work. You find a small, defensible hollow and set up a tidy, well-hidden camp. This is an exceptionally secure campsite, granting you a **+2 bonus** to each of the night's Encounter Checks."

## Phase 4: Watches

As Borin roasted stag meat over a crackling fire, the party planned their watches. They would burn one unit of firewood (+2 bonus/watch), combined with their Cautious Pace (+2) and excellent campsite (+2), for a **total bonus of +6** on each watch's **Encounter Check** (Difficulty: Medium).

**First Watch (Alaric):** His roll of 12, plus +1 Intuition and +6 bonus, totaled **19**. A **Success with a Reward**. Everyone gained an additional recovery.

**Second Watch (Finn):** His roll of 9, plus +2 Intuition and +6 bonus, totaled **17**. Another **Success with a Reward**. Everyone gained another recovery.

**Third Watch (Ghorza):** Her roll of 7, plus 0 Intuition and +6 bonus, totaled **13**. A **Success**. The Director narrated a minor disturbance from a predator that was scared off. The party gained their recovery, but Ghorza did not.

The party awoke feeling rested and well-supplied. The day had started with a frustrating failure, but their quick thinking had turned it into a productive success. They had ample food, water, and firewood, and a clear, confirmed path for the morning. The mountains still loomed, but now, they felt ready for them.
