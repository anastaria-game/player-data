# Classes

While all your character creation decisions bear narrative weight, none influences the way you play the game like your choice of class. Your class determines how your hero battles the threats of the timescape and overcomes other obstacles. Do you bend elemental forces to your will through the practiced casting of magic spells? Do you channel the ferocity of the Primordial Chaos as you tear across the battlefield, felling foes left and right? Or do you belt out heroic ballads that give your allies a second wind and inspire them to ever-greater achievements?

Your class provides you with many of your features, most of your abilities—your most potent combat moves and noncombat options and a Heroic Resource that fuels many of those abilities. This book presents nine classes to choose from.

[**Censor:**](#censor) A censor is a trained warrior devoted to a saint or god. They hunt down the forces of evil using melee weapons and magic granted to them by their divine patron, specializing in confronting the wicked and locking down single enemies during combat.

[**Conduit:**](#conduit) A conduit is the devoted priest of a saint or god. They wield divine magic that smites enemies with holy energy and supports their allies, and are renowned for their healing abilities.

[**Elementalist:**](#elementalist) An elementalist studies the elemental forces of the timescape and controls earth, fire, the void, and more with magic. Many of their abilities cover wide areas of the battlefield, and they have a versatile array of tricks that allow them to both control combat and manipulate the environment around them when the fight is done.

[**Fury:**](#fury) Coursing with the ferocity of the Primordial Chaos in their veins, a fury is a mobile warrior who gets up close and personal with enemies to dish out lots of damage. Leaping around the battlefield felling foes and breaking down walls is where the fury lives.

[**Null:**](#null) Disciplined and calm, the null is an unarmed warrior who manifests an aura that quells the supernatural and hinders the offensive prowess of their enemies. They use psionics to make their body stronger than any steel and faster than any steed.

[**Shadow:**](#shadow) Stalking from the darkness, the shadow is an expert assassin and thief who fights equally well in melee and at range as they get the drop on their foes. They utilize magic to help them stay mobile on the battlefield and sneak up on their prey.

[**Tactician:**](#tactician) A brilliant strategist and weapons master, the tactician excels at granting allies more movement and actions on the battlefield. They also support allies outside of combat, always inspiring their friends to greatness.

[**Talent:**](#talent) A talent is the master of psionics, manifesting powers that manipulate objects, minds, and time. These heroes can reach far into themselves to use abilities even when they don't have their Heroic Resource to spare—if they're willing to face the cost.

[**Troubadour:**](#troubadour) A troubadour inspires their allies with storytelling and swordplay that is as much an art as it is an act of war. Their quips, songs, poems, and epic tales produce actual magic that harms foes and bolsters allies. They can even use their magic to tweak the campaign's story in real time to better suit their needs.

### Subclasses

Each class also has a number of subclasses presented in this book. Your subclass determines many of your hero's abilities and features, and further defines how you interact with the world from 1st level on. You choose a subclass when you create your character.

### Abilities

Abilities are special actions, maneuvers, and more that allow you to affect creatures, objects, and the environment. They represent the main activities your character can undertake when the game is in combat or some other time-sensitive scenario. All characters have access to a few basic abilities, including free strikes and maneuvers such as Grab and Knockback (see [Maneuvers](12-Combat.md#maneuvers) in [Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md)). But your class, ancestry (see [Chapter 5: Ancestries](#ancestries)), kit ([Chapter 8: Kits](#kit)), titles and treasures ([Chapter 16: Rewards](16-Rewards.md)), and other heroic options give you access to more powerful abilities that make your hero stand out.

Abilities are presented in a special format that first describes the ability, then summarizes its mechanical details, and finally breaks out the ability's power roll (if it has one) and effects.

> **Abilities in Combat**
>
> All the abilities appearing in this book are used as a main action, a maneuver, a triggered action, or some other part of your turn. As such, these abilities are all explicitly usable in combat or some other time-sensitive scenario where the game unfolds as combat rounds. If a creature has an ability that takes 1 minute or longer to use, that ability can't be used in combat.

#### Name and Story Text

Each ability has an evocative name that sets up what it does in the game, followed by a line or two of flavor text that provides a sense of how the use of the ability might appear if described in an action scene in a story.

The name and story text for abilities sometimes refers to specific ways in which the ability plays out—particularly combat abilities whose names imply specific types of weapons or tactics. However, that narrative flavor has no effect on how an ability can be used. For example, the fury's Impaled ability allows you to grab a target, setting up the idea of harpooning your monstrous foe with a sword to keep them close. But you can use that ability with an axe, a mace, a hammer, or any other weapon.

#### Heroic Resource Cost

Each class has a Heroic Resource that your hero earns during combat, with some of your class's abilities—typically your most potent abilities—having a Heroic Resource cost to use them. When you use one of these abilities, you spend some of the Heroic Resource bestowed by your class, then activate the ability.

The nine Heroic Resources in the game are:

* The censor's [_wrath_](#wrath)
* The conduit's [_piety_](#piety)
* The elementalist's [_essence_](#essence)
* The fury's [_ferocity_](#ferocity)
* The null's [_discipline_](#discipline)
* The shadow's [_insight_](#insight)
* The tactician's [_focus_](#focus)
* The talent's [_clarity_](#clarity)
* The troubadour's [_drama_](#drama)

##### Heroic Abilities

If an ability has a Heroic Resource cost to activate—as in, you can't use the ability at all without spending some of your Heroic Resource—then it is a heroic ability. If an effect allows you to use a heroic ability when it isn't your turn, you must still pay its Heroic Resource cost to use it unless the effect says otherwise.

Some abilities don't cost your Heroic Resource to use but allow you to spend your Heroic Resource to enhance or add effects to the ability, such as the conduit's Healing Grace. These abilities are not heroic abilities unless the baseline ability can't be used without spending your Heroic Resource.

##### Signature Abilities

Some abilities granted by your class, kit, and other parts of the game are signature abilities. The rules specifically state when an ability is a signature ability. Signature abilities don't require your Heroic Resource to use, but sometimes let you spend your Heroic Resource to enhance or add to their effects.

#### Ability Keywords

Each ability has one or more keywords that explain how the ability functions. Keywords appear in the first line of the ability beneath the flavor text, on the left side, and can include any of the following entries. (An ability that has no keywords is noted as "-".)

##### Area

Abilities with the Area keyword create an area of effect. Many area abilities deal damage to targets in their area, but such abilities are treated differently than strikes made against specific targets. (See the [It's Not All Strikes!](#its-not-all-strikes) sidebar, as well as [Strike](#strike) and [Area Abilities](#area-abilities) below for more information.)

##### Charge

Abilities with the Charge keyword can be used with the Charge main action instead of a melee free strike. (The Charge main action is described in Main [Actions](12-Combat.md#actions) in [Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md).)

##### Magic

Abilities with the Magic keyword are used by characters who can cast spells, have innate magical features, or wield magic treasures. Such abilities do magical things such as create rays of fire, open swirling portals, or summon creatures.

##### Melee

Abilities with the Melee keyword can be used only over very short distances, typically within a character's reach, because they require a character to make contact with a creature or object with their body, a weapon, or an implement. (An implement is a special object used by characters channeling magic or psionic power, described in [Imbue Treasure](15-Downtime-Projects.md#imbue-treasure) in [Chapter 15: Downtime Projects](15-Downtime-Projects.md).)

##### Psionic

Abilities with the Psionic keyword are used by characters who can manifest psionic powers, have innate psionic features, or wield psionic items. These abilities might create blasts of psychic energy, move objects with telekinesis, or slow down time with chronopathy.

##### Ranged

Abilities with the Ranged keyword can be used to affect creatures who are too far away to make contact with.

##### Strike

Abilities with the Strike keyword (often referred to simply as "strikes") deal damage to or impose a harmful effect on specific creatures or objects.

> **It's Not All Strikes!**
>
> The Strike keyword and phrases such as "makes a strike" are reserved for abilities that have a creature targeting specific creatures or objects (not affecting creatures or objects in an area) and harming those targets in some way by making a power roll. The many abilities in the game that target areas of effect are not strikes. They instead use the Area keyword. That means if a feature distinctly interacts with a strike, that feature has no effect on abilities with the Area keyword.

##### Weapon

The Weapon keyword is used in abilities that must be used with a blade, a bow, or some other offensive weapon. Weapon abilities also include strikes creatures make with their own bodies, such as a character's unarmed strikes or a monster's punches, kicks, bites, tail slaps, and more.

Your character's kit determines the types of weapons you wield and use with your weapon abilities (see [Chapter 8: Kits](08-Kits.md)).

#### Type

Each ability notes the type of activity required to use it, on the right side of the first line beneath the flavor text. Most abilities require you to use a main action, a maneuver, a move action, a triggered action, a free maneuver, or a free triggered action (with all those terms explained in [Taking a Turn](12-Combat.md#taking-a-turn) in [Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md)). For instance, if you use an ability that has "Main Action" as its type entry, you must use your main action to activate the ability.

##### Trigger

If an ability requires a triggered action or a free triggered action to use, a "Trigger" entry is part of the ability. For example, the trigger for the tactician's Parry ability is: "A creature deals damage to the target." A tactician can use their Parry ability only when that specific triggering event occurs.

#### Distance

An ability's "Distance" entry, represented by this symbol e, indicates how close you need to be to a creature or object to affect that target with the ability.

##### Melee

Melee abilities have a distance of "Melee X" and require you to make contact with a creature with your body, a weapon, or an implement. The number X is the maximum distance in squares at which you can physically make contact with another creature or object targeted by the ability. For instance, a distance of "Melee 2" can be used to target creatures or objects within 2 squares of you, while "Melee 1" limits you to adjacent targets (those within 1 square).

##### Ranged

Ranged abilities have a distance of "Ranged X" and can be used to target creatures or objects too far away for you to make contact with. The number X is the maximum distance in squares at which a creature or object can be targeted by the ability. For instance, a distance of "Ranged 5" can be used to target creatures or objects within 5 squares of you.

If you make a ranged strike while any enemy is adjacent to you (within 1 square), you have a bane on the strike's power roll. (see [Edges and Banes](03-Basics.md#edges-and-banes) in [Chapter 3: Basics](03-Basics.md)).

##### Melee or Ranged

Some abilities have a melee distance and a ranged distance. When you use such an ability, you choose whether to use it as a melee or a ranged ability.

An ability never has both the Melee and Ranged keywords at the same time. For example, if you have the Cloak and Dagger kit, which has a weapon damage bonus to melee abilities and a weapon damage bonus to ranged abilities, only one bonus at a time applies to an ability with both the Melee and Ranged keywords. (see [Chapter 8: Kits](08-Kits.md)).

##### Self

If an ability has a distance of "Self," that ability originates from you, and often affects only you. The ability's description specifies how it works.

#### Area Abilities

Area abilities cover a number of squares on the battlefield at once, creating an effect within that area that lets you target multiple creatures or objects. When an ability creates an area of effect, it sometimes notes a distance for the effect in the form "within X." The number X tells you how many squares away from you the area can be. If an area ability doesn't have this distance, it originates from you and you are at the center of the area.

If an area ability originates a distance away from you, then one square of the area of effect must be within that distance, and must also be within your line of effect (see below). This square is referred to as the **origin square** of the area of effect. The area of effect can spread from the origin square however you choose, according to the rules for the shape and arrangement of that particular area.

You can place an area of effect to include one or more squares where you don't have line of effect, as long as you have line of effect to the origin square. Unless otherwise noted, area abilities don't pass through solid barriers such as walls or ceilings, and they don't spread around corners.

An area ability might use any of the following areas of effect.

##### Aura

When an ability creates an aura, that area is expressed as "X aura." The number X is the radius of the aura, which always originates from you and moves with you for the duration of the ability that created it. A creature or object must be within X squares of you to be targeted by an aura ability.

##### Burst

When an ability creates a burst area, that area is expressed as "X burst." The number X is the radius of the burst, which always originates from you and lasts only for as long as it takes to affect its targets. A creature or object must be within X squares of you to be targeted by a burst ability.

##### Cube

When an ability affects a cubic area, that area is expressed as "X cube." The number X is the length of each of the area's sides. A creature or object must be within the area to be targeted by a cube ability.

##### Line

When an ability affects a linear area, that area is expressed as "A x B line." The number A denotes the line's length in squares, while the number B equals the line's width and height in squares. When you create a line area of effect, the squares in that area must be in a straight line. A creature or object must be within the area to be targeted by a line ability.

##### Wall

When an ability creates a wall, that area is expressed as "X wall." The number X is how many squares are used to make the wall. When you place a wall, you can build it one square at a time, but each square must share at least one side (not just a corner) with another square of the wall. A creature or object must be within the area to be targeted by a wall ability.

You can stack squares on top of each other to make the wall higher. Unless otherwise stated, a wall can't be placed in occupied squares, and a wall blocks line of effect.

> **Straight Lines**
>
> Talking about a straight line area of effect on an encounter map doesn't mean the line can only be a straight vertical or horizontal line of contiguous squares. It means each square in the line's length must move in the same direction without bending back in an opposite direction. To make a line area quickly, pick your line's origin square, then pick each subsquent square in the line one at a time in a single direction without bending back in an opposite direction.
>
> Likewise, abilities and effects that require a creature to move in a straight line, such as the Charge main action or forced movement that is a push or a pull, don't have to take the form of a straight series of squares on the grid. Simply move the creature one square at a time in a single direction without ever bending back in a direction opposite to where they've already moved.

#### Target

The "Target" entry of an ability, represented by this symbol x, notes the number of creatures, objects, or both who can be targeted by that ability. You can always affect fewer targets than the number indicated by this entry.

##### Creature

If an ability targets one or more creatures, it can affect creatures within the ability's distance or area. You aren't an eligible creature target for your own abilities unless those abilities also have "self" as a target (see below), or unless the ability indicates otherwise.

##### Object

If an ability targets one or more objects, it can affect any object within the ability's distance or area. Unless otherwise noted, objects have poison immunity all and psychic immunity all. ([Damage](12-Combat.md#damage) in [Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md) has information on damage immunity.)

When an ability can target creatures and objects, the ability can damage objects. However, unless otherwise noted (as with the talent's Minor Telekinesis ability) or if the Director allows it, objects are immune to an ability's other effects. If an ability forces an object to make a test, the object automatically gets a tier 1 result on the test.

##### Enemy

If an ability targets one or more enemies, it can affect only creatures who are hostile to the creature using the ability. Typically, you decide who counts as an enemy for the purpose of using your hero's abilities, though the Director has the final say.

##### Ally

If an ability targets one or more allies, it can affect only willing creatures who are friendly to the creature using the ability. Typically, you and any other player whose character you target with an ability decide who counts as an ally, though the Director has the final say.

You aren't an eligible target for your own abilities that target allies unless those abilities also have "self" as a target, or unless the ability indicates otherwise.

##### Self

If an ability targets "self," it can affect only the creature using the ability. Your own abilities can affect you only if they target "self."

##### Each \[Target]

If an area ability doesn't provide a number of targets but instead says it applies to each creature, object, enemy, or ally in the area, then all eligible targets for the ability are affected.

> **Telling Friend From Foe**
>
> There might be times when a foe disguises or obscures themself so that they're temporarily seen as an ally—or at least not seen as an enemy. Until the effect ends, such a creature can't be targeted by abilities that would usually target them by targeting enemies. Fear not, though. All classes have access to at least one ability that targets creatures, whether friend or foe.

#### Ability Roll

If an ability requires a power roll, it has a "Power Roll" entry that tells you which characteristic to add to the 2d10 roll you make when you use the ability. ([Chapter 3: Basics](03-Basics.md) talks about power rolls.)

Unlike power rolls made as tests (see Chapter 9), ability rolls always do something useful. You're rolling to determine the impact of the ability, including how much damage it deals and any other effects it imposes based on the tier outcome of the power roll. For instance, the fury's Brutal Slam ability is a melee strike that targets one adjacent creature (within 1 square), and which has the following effects:

* **Tier 1 (11 or lower):** The ability deals damage equal to 3 + your Might score, then pushes the target back 1 square.
* **Tier 2 (12-16):** The ability deals damage equal to 6 + your Might score, then pushes the target back 2 squares.
* **Tier 3 (17 or higher):** The ability deals damage equal to 9 + your Might score, then pushes the target back 4 squares.

###### Characteristics and Damage

Certain damage-dealing abilities note that damage as a number followed by a plus sign (+) and the letter `▏M▕`, `▏A▕`, `▏R▕`, `▏I▕`, or `▏P▕`. The indicated letter means you add your characteristic score—either Might, Agility, Reason, Intuition, or Presence—to the damage dealt by the ability. Certain abilities let you use your highest characteristic score for the power roll.

Using the fury's Brutal Slam ability as an example again, that ability uses a Might power roll and features the following damage expressions in the three tier outcomes of the power roll:

* **≤11:**  3 + `▏M▕` damage
* **12-16:**  6 + `▏M▕` damage
* **17+:**  9 + `▏M▕` damage

For a fury with a Might of 2, the ability's damage breakdown would be:

* **≤11:** 5
* **12-16:** 8
* **17+:** 11

The damage for these abilities increases at each echelon of play, since your characteristics improve each time you reach a new echelon.

Some abilities, including your free strikes, allow you to pick which characteristic score you add to their damage. Such abilities use a format similar to "7 + `▏M▕` or `▏A▕` damage," indicating that you can add your Might or your Agility to determine the damage.

([Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md) has more information on damage.)

##### Abilities With Damage and Effects

Strikes and area abilities can deal damage and have an additional effect on a target. The damage and the strength of the effect are determined by the ability roll.

To keep things moving quickly and to make abilities easy to read during play, damage and effects are separated with a semicolon in a power roll tier entry, with effects abbreviated whenever possible. An effect determined by a power roll always applies to the target unless otherwise specified. For example, the Brutal Slam ability mentioned above has the following power roll setup in the ability format:

**Power Roll + Might:**

* **≤11:**  3 + `▏M▕` damage; push 1
* **12-16:**  6 + `▏M▕` damage; push 2
* **17+:**  9 + `▏M▕` damage; push 4

Unless otherwise indicated, any effects that are determined by a power roll's tier outcome occur after the power roll's damage has been dealt to all targets. If an ability roll deals damage to multiple targets but its effect targets the creature using the ability or the Director, such as Muse of Fire, then the effect only occurs once, not once per target. If different tiered outcomes affect multiple targets, the creature using the ability picks which tier of rolled effect applies to them or the Director. If an ability creates multiple effects, those effects resolve in the order in which they are presented.

#### "During the Move"

Certain ability effects allow you to move and affect other creatures or objects during that move, such as the shadow's One Hundred Throats ability. For such abilities, the move begins in the space you first leave when you start the move and ends in the last space you move into.

#### Rolled Damage

Certain effects talk about rolled damage, which refers to the variable damage determined by making an ability roll. If an ability or effect deals damage without requiring a power roll, that is not rolled damage, and effects that add to or are triggered by rolled damage don't apply.

#### Potencies

Many abilities and other effects impose conditions and unique statuses on targets. But creatures sometimes get a chance to resist such effects. After all, a monster with a high Might should be harder to knock prone most of the time than a creature lacking in that characteristic.

Ability effects that have a **potency** are applied to a target only if the effect's potency value is higher than the target's indicated characteristic score. The characteristic a target uses to resist a potency is based on the ability used, while the value of the potency for your hero's abilities is based on one of your characteristics and determined by your class.

Your character has a **weak**, an **average**, and a **strong** potency value, as follows:

* Your weak potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score − 2.
* Your average potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score − 1.
* Your strong potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score.

In abilities and other effects, a potency always appears as the single-letter abbreviation for the target's characteristic: M for Might, A for Agility, R for Reason, I for Intuition, or P for Presence. That characteristic is followed by a "less than" sign (<) and your potency value—for example, `▏M▕` < `▏WEAK▕` or `▏R▕` < `▏AVERAGE▕` -with the value indicating the minimum score in that characteristic that the target needs to beat the effect.

As an example, consider the conduit's Judgment's Hammer ability, which has the following power roll:

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

* **≤11:**  3 + `▏I▕` holy damage; `▏A▕` < `▏WEAK▕`, prone
* **12-16:**  6 + `▏I▕` holy damage; `▏A▕` < `▏AVERAGE▕`, prone
* **17+:**  9 + `▏I▕` holy damage; `▏A▕` < `▏STRONG▕`, prone and can't stand (save ends)

At 1st level, a conduit uses their Intuition score to determine their potency values, and that score is 2. That gives the conduit the following potencies:

* Weak: 0
* Average: 1
* Strong: 2

When writing Judgment's Hammer on their character sheet, the conduit's player updates the damage and converts the weak, average, and strong potencies into their numerical values, knowing that those values won't change until the character hits 2nd echelon and their Intuition score becomes 3. That produces the following:

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

* **≤11:** 5 holy damage; A < 0, prone
* **12-16:** 8 holy damage; A < 1, prone
* **17+:** 11 holy damage; A < 2, prone and can't stand (save ends)

During a game session, the conduit uses Judgment's Hammer to target a bandit with an Agility score of 0. The ability thus has the following outcomes at each tier:

* With a tier 1 outcome (11 or lower), the ability deals 5 holy damage to the bandit. But the bandit resists the additional effect because they have Agility 0 (and therefore don't have an Agility of less than 0).
* With a tier 2 outcome (12-16), the ability deals 8 holy damage. But the bandit is also knocked prone, unable to resist the additional effect because they would need an Agility of 1 or higher to do so. If the bandit had Agility 1 or higher, they would have taken 8 holy damage but stayed standing.
* With a tier 3 outcome (17 or higher), the bandit takes 11 holy damage and is knocked flat and left struggling to stand, unable to resist the strong potency of the additional effect with a mere Agility 0.

##### Potency Presentation

Potencies are presented in an abbreviated style in abilities so they don't take up too much space, and so you can read them by saying: "If the target's \[characteristic] is less than \[potency value], they \[suffer effect]." If our 1st-level conduit obtained a tier 2 outcome when using Judgment's Hammer, the player would say, "I deal 8 holy damage, and if the bandit's Agility is less than 1, they fall prone."

Reading the ability this way prevents a lot of back and forth. You don't need to ask, "What's the target's Agility score?", wait for a response, and then give the outcome. You can simply say, "If they don't have an Agility of 1 or higher, they fall prone." Players can let the Director figure out whether the target is prone and keep the game moving, with the Director doing the same in reverse when monsters and other foes use abilities with potencies against the heroes.

##### Adjusting Potencies

Potencies are made for quick resolution at the table, but a number of triggered actions and other abilities—for example, the censor's Judgment ability and the null's Null Field ability—allow you to manipulate the value of potencies. If you build a hero who can adjust potencies, pay attention during combat! You might be able to help out a friend who needs a little boost to make their ability take full effect, or hinder an enemy about to lock down one of your allies.

##### Spending Resources on Potencies

If an ability or feature allows you to spend your Heroic Resource on an effect that is entirely dependent on a potency and the target is unaffected because their characteristic is high enough to resist the potency, then you don't spend the Heroic Resource.

For example, the tactician's Overwatch ability allows the tactician to spend 1 focus to impose the slowed condition on a target who has `▏R▕` < `▏AVERAGE▕`. Since spending focus this way has no other effect, if the tactician targets a creature whose high Reason leaves them unaffected, the tactician doesn't waste any focus. However, if spending this focus had another automatic effect such as dealing extra damage to the target, the 1 focus would be spent even though the potency was resisted.

This rule also applies to Director-controlled creatures who spend Malice on abilities and features that affect a target using a potency and have no other automatic effects.

#### Critical Hit

Whenever you make an ability roll as a main action and the roll is a natural 19 or natural 20-a total of 19 or 20 before adding your characteristic score or other modifiers—you score a critical hit. A critical hit allows you to immediately take an additional main action after resolving the power roll, whether or not it's your turn and even if you are dazed (see [Conditions](#conditions) below).

You can't score a critical hit with an ability roll made as a maneuver or any other action type, but you can score a critical hit with a main action you use off your turn. For example, an opportunity attack made as a triggered action or a signature ability used as a free triggered action with the assistance of the tactician's Strike Now ability can be critical hits.

#### Roll Against Multiple Creatures

When an ability has multiple targets (whether a strike with more than one target or an area affect), you make one power roll and apply the total to all targets. If you have edges or banes (see [Chapter 3: Basics](03-Basics.md)) against some but not all of your targets, you might apply a different tier outcome to individual targets.

For example, if you target three creatures with a strike ability and the power roll totals 11, each of the targets should be affected by the tier 1 outcome of the ability. However, if you gain an edge on strikes against one of the targets to add 2 to the power roll, your total against that target is 13, and they are affected by the tier 2 outcome of the ability.

#### Surges

A troubadour's battle song, a fury's building ferocity, and a shadow's patient insight can all make a hero more effective in a fight. These advantages are represented by surges, with many abilities granting heroes surges during a battle.

When you gain surges, you keep track of them on your character sheet. Surges can be used in combat to deal extra damage to your foes and increase the value of your potencies, as follows:

* Whenever you deal rolled damage, you can spend up to 3 surges to deal extra damage to one creature or object targeted by the ability. Each surge you spend deals extra damage equal to your highest characteristic score.
* Whenever you target one or more creatures with an ability that has a potency, you can spend 2 surges to increase the potency by 1 for one target. You can't increase a potency by more than 1 using surges, though you can spend additional surges to increase the potency for multiple targets.

You lose surges as you spend them. At the end of combat, you lose any surges you have remaining.

#### Effect

Many abilities that require power rolls also have effect entries describing additional effects or rules for how the ability is used. If an ability doesn't require a power roll, it has an effect entry that describes how it works.

##### Actions Within Actions

If an ability's effect allows you to take a main action, a maneuver, a move action, or a triggered action, the cost of doing so is subsumed in the ability's type entry on the first line below the flavor text. You never need to spend additional time to use an ability. For example, the shadow's Black Ash Teleport ability is a maneuver that allows you to teleport and then use the Hide maneuver as its overall effect. Using the Hide maneuver is part of the maneuver to use the ability, so that you don't need to have another maneuver available to do so.

#### Spend Heroic Resource

Some abilities have a "Spend X \[Heroic Resource]" entry in the body of the ability. These grant additional effects to an ability, where X is the amount of your Heroic Resource you must spend to activate those effects. If an entry reads "Spend X+ \[Heroic Resource]," you can spend as much of your available Heroic Resource as you like in multiples of X to increase the effect's impact, as described in the entry's details.

#### Stacking Unique Effects

The unique effects of different abilities are combined—effectively stacking on top of each other—if their durations and targets overlap. However, the effects of the same ability used multiple times don't stack. Instead, the most impactful effect—such as the highest bonus—from each use of the ability applies. The most recently used ability applies for determining duration.

For example, the null's Null Field ability reduces the potencies of enemies within the field by 1. If two allied nulls each have their Null Field ability active and an enemy cultist is targeted by both abilities, that cultist's potencies are reduced by 1, not by 2.

Different effects that impose the same condition (see [Conditions](#conditions) below) don't stack to impose the condition twice. For instance, if a hero is targeted by numerous creatures whose abilities cause a target to become weakened (imposing a bane on the target's power rolls), the target isn't weakened twice to impose a double bane on those rolls. A character who is grabbed by an enemy can't be grabbed again by another enemy. The same holds true for game effects that aren't conditions. For example, if a hero is targeted by multiple abilities or effects that can halve their recovery value, the hero's recovery value is halved only once.

#### Ending Effects

When a creature suffers a lasting effect, whatever ability, feature, hazard, or other mechanic imposed the effect specifies how long the effect lasts. Unless otherwise noted, all effects and conditions that are imposed on heroes during a combat encounter end when the encounter is over if the hero wants them to, except for being winded, unconscious, or dying. After combat, effects and conditions imposed on other creatures end when it's convenient for the heroes, allowing characters to easily bind or slip away from unconscious foes. However, the Director is free to decide that an unconscious dragon doesn't stay that way long enough to be tied up.

##### End of Next Turn (EoT)

Many effects last until the end of the target's next turn, abbreviated as "(EoT)" in the tier outcomes for an ability's power roll. A creature suffers from such an effect until the end of their next turn, or the end of their current turn if the effect was imposed on their current turn.

##### Saving Throw (Save Ends)

If an effect has "(save ends)" at the end of its description, a creature suffering the effect makes a saving throw at the end of each of their turns to remove the effect. A saving throw represents the sheer luck involved in shaking off an effect. Because a target typically had a chance to avoid a "save ends" effect using a characteristic score to resist a potency, it's now down to fate.

To make a saving throw, a creature rolls a d10. On a 6 or higher, the effect ends. Otherwise, it continues.

##### End of Encounter

Some effects last until the end of the encounter. If such an effect is used outside of combat, it lasts 5 minutes.

##### Creature Ends an Ability Effect

A creature who imposes an effect on another creature using an ability can end that effect as a free maneuver unless the ability says otherwise.

##### Adjacent

Many abilities and other options refer to creatures, objects, or spaces that are adjacent to a specified creature. Something is adjacent to a creature if it is within 1 square of that creature.

#### Line of Effect

To target a creature or object with an ability or effect, including making a strike against them, you must have line of effect to that target. If any solid object, such as a wall or pillar, completely blocks the target from you, then you don't have line of effect.

If you're not sure whether you have line of effect to a target, imagine drawing a straight line from any corner of the space you occupy on an encounter map to any corner of a space the target occupies. If one or more corners of your space connect to any corner of the target's space with no obstruction in between, you have line of effect to the target.

At the Director's discretion, flimsy or fragile obstructions such as a glass window or linen curtains don't block line of effect, and might be automatically broken or torn by strikes or other abilities used through them.

If you use an ability that creates an environmental effect, such as a portal, you must have line of effect to the space where you create the environmental effect. If you want to create an area of effect in a specific area, you must have line of effect to at least one of the squares in that area. See [Area Abilities](#area-abilities) above.

#### Straight Line

Whenever a creature moves or is subjected to forced movement—a push, pull, or slide (see [Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md))—that movement is typically in a straight line. Abilities that allow you to move or to force move another creature often talk about moving straight toward or away from a creature or an object. But even when movement must be in a straight line, it doesn't have to be a horizontal or vertical line on an encounter map. (See the [Straight Lines](#straight-lines) sidebar earlier in this chapter.)

#### Ground and Ceiling

Some abilities and other effects refer to a hero or their targets being "on the ground." Unless otherwise indicated, "ground" means any surface a creature could typically stand, sit, or lie upon, whether a castle's stone floor, the dirt of a road, the deck of a ship, or a metal platform suspended high in the air.

Likewise, if an effect refers to a "ceiling," that means any solid surface above a creature, whether a wooden tavern ceiling, the rocky roof of a cave, or an invisible wall of force.

#### Conditions

Some abilities and other effects apply specific negative effects called conditions to a creature. The following conditions show up regularly in the game and can be tracked on your character sheet when they affect your hero.

##### Bleeding

While a creature is bleeding, whenever they use a main action, use a triggered action, or make a test or ability roll using Might or Agility, they lose Stamina equal to 1d6 + their level after the main action, triggered action, or power roll is resolved. This Stamina loss can't be prevented in any way.

You take damage from this condition when you use a main action off your turn. For example, a signature ability used as a free triggered action with the assistance of the tactician's Strike Now ability triggers the damage from the bleeding condition.

##### Dazed

A creature who is dazed can do only one thing on their turn: use a main action, use a maneuver, or use a move action. A dazed creature also can't use triggered actions, free triggered actions, or free maneuvers.

##### Frightened

When a creature is frightened, any ability roll they make against the source of their fear takes a bane. If that source is a creature, their ability rolls made against the frightened creature gain an edge. A frightened creature can't willingly move closer to the source of their fear if they know the location of that source. If a creature gains the frightened condition from one source while already frightened by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.

##### Grabbed

A creature who is grabbed has speed 0, can't be force moved except by a creature, object, or effect that has them grabbed, can't use the Knockback maneuver (see [Maneuvers](12-Combat.md#maneuvers) in [Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md)), and takes a bane on abilities that don't target the creature, object, or effect that has them grabbed. If a creature is grabbed by another creature and that creature moves, they bring the grabbed creature with them. If a creature's size is equal to or less than the size of a creature they have grabbed, their speed is halved while they have that creature grabbed.

A creature who has another creature grabbed can use a maneuver to move the grabbed creature into an unoccupied space adjacent to them.

A creature can release a creature they have grabbed at any time to end that condition (no action required). A grabbed creature can attempt to escape being grabbed using the Escape Grab maneuver (see [Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md)). If a grabbed creature teleports, or if either the grabbed creature or the creature grabbing them is force moved so that both creatures are not adjacent to each other, that creature is no longer grabbed.

A creature can grab only creatures of their size or smaller. If a creature's Might score is 2 or higher, they can grab any creature larger than them with a size equal to or less than their Might score.

Unless otherwise indicated, a creature can grab only one creature at a time.

##### Prone

While a creature is prone, they are flat on the ground, any strike they make takes a bane, and melee abilities used against them gain an edge. A prone creature must crawl to move along the ground, which costs 1 additional square of movement for every square crawled. A creature can't climb, jump, swim, or fly while prone. If they are climbing, flying, or jumping when knocked prone, they fall.

Unless the ability or effect that imposed the prone condition says otherwise, a prone creature can stand up using the Stand Up maneuver (see [Maneuvers](12-Combat.md#maneuvers) in [Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md)). A creature adjacent to a willing prone creature can likewise use the Stand Up maneuver to make that creature stand up.

##### Restrained

A creature who is restrained has speed 0, can't use the Stand Up maneuver, and can't be force moved. A restrained creature takes a bane on ability rolls and on Might and Agility tests, and abilities used against them gain an edge.

If a creature teleports while restrained, that condition ends.

##### Slowed

A creature who is slowed has speed 2 unless their speed is already lower, and they can't shift.

##### Taunted

A creature who is taunted has a double bane on ability rolls for any ability that doesn't target the creature who taunted them, as long as they have line of effect to that creature. If a creature gains the taunted condition from one source while already taunted by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.

##### Weakened

A creature who is weakened takes a bane on power rolls.

#### Abilities in Class Tables

Each class in this chapter includes a table that shows the progression as a hero gains new levels in that class. Each of those tables has an Abilities column and another column that shows abilities granted by the hero's subclass, tracking all the heroic abilities a hero of that class has at each level. Each ability is represented by a numeral noting the ability's Heroic Resource cost.

For example a 6th-level censor has "Signature, 3, 5, 7, 9" in their Abilities column, and "5, 9" in their Order Abilities column (representing the censor's subclass). This means a censor of that level has a signature ability and four heroic abilities costing 3, 5, 7, and 9 wrath respectively, plus an additional two subclass heroic abilities costing 5 and 9 wrath.

> **Quick Build Gold Icons**

> Abilities granted by your class that are quick build options are indicated by a gold icon to the left of their name. Look for this icon if you're using the quick build options when creating your hero:

## Censor

Demons and deathless fear you. Criminals run from the sight of your shadow. Agents of chaos, blasphemers, and heretics tremble at the sound of your voice. You carry the power of the gods, armed with wrath and sent out into the world first to seek, then censor those whose actions—or even existence—are anathema to your church.

As a censor, you're at your best against the strongest foes. Your judgment terrifies heretics, stops enemies in their tracks, and even hurls them across the battlefield.

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Might of 2 and a Presence of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

* 2, −1, −1
* 1, 1, −1
* 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Presence − 2

**Average Potency:** Presence − 1

**Strong Potency:** Presence

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 21

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 9

**Recoveries:** 12

**Skills:** Choose any two skills from the interpersonal or lore skill groups (see [Skills](06-Background.md#skills) in Chapter 9: Tests). (*Quick Build:* Intimidate, Religion.)

> **House Rule: Judgment of Chaos**
>
> A Censor's connection to the ordered nature of the Loom makes their judgment particularly potent against creatures of pure chaos. When a Censor with a Wyld Acclimatization score of 9 or less uses their Judgment ability on a creature with the Elemental keyword (such as a Kaotikoi), the target takes a bane to its saving throws against any of the Censor's abilities.

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level censor, you gain the following features.

#### Censor Order

Censors are the will of their god made physically manifest, and you act as your god's agent in the world. As you shoulder that responsibility, you choose a censor order from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Paragon.)

* **Exorcist:** You specialize in hunting your order's hidden enemies, knowing that an open mind is an unguarded fortress. You have the Read Person skill.
* **Oracle:** Corruption has deep tendrils that can be missed, leading you to specialize in uncovering clandestine threats to your order. You have the Magic skill.
* **Paragon:** Without a strong example and a firm hand, the weak will be corrupted. You specialize in setting an example for your order. You have the Lead skill.

Your censor order is your subclass, and your choice of order determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

#### Deity and Domains

Choose a god or saint who your character reveres from Chapter 14: Gods and Religion, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity and choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick one domain from their portfolio. Your choice of domain determines many of the features you'll gain from this class. (*Quick Build:* Cavall as deity and War as domain.)

#### Wrath

The power you serve grants you a Heroic Resource called wrath, fueling your abilities as you censor those your church deems to be heretics.

##### Wrath in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain wrath equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 wrath.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that a creature judged by you (see [Judgment](#judgment) below) deals damage to you, you gain 1 wrath. The first time each combat round that you deal damage to a creature judged by you, you gain 1 wrath.

You lose any remaining wrath at the end of the encounter.

##### Wrath Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain wrath outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost wrath without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs wrath, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited wrath on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of wrath equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the censor, but they might appear in future products.)

#### Judgment

You pick out the enemies most worthy of your wrath and place a divine judgment upon them, censoring them with the power of your god. You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Judgment</span>**

*You utter a prayer that outlines your foe in holy energy.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |     **Maneuver** |
| ----------------- | ---------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 One enemy** |

**Effect:** The target is judged by you until the end of the encounter, you use this ability again, you willingly end this effect (no action required), or another censor judges the target.

Whenever a creature judged by you uses a main action and is within your line of effect, you can use a free triggered action to deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to them.

When a creature judged by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to use this ability against a new target.

Additionally, you can spend 1 wrath to take one of the following free triggered actions:

* When an adjacent creature judged by you starts to shift, you make a melee free strike against them and their speed becomes 0 until the end of the current turn, preventing them from shifting.
* When a creature judged by you within 10 squares makes a power roll, you cause them to take a bane on the roll.
* When a creature judged by you within 10 squares uses an ability with a potency that targets only one creature, the potency is reduced by 1 for that creature.
* If you damage a creature judged by you with a melee ability, the creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.

You can choose only one free triggered action option at a time, even if multiple options are triggered by the same effect.

##### Judgment Order Benefit

The first time on a turn that you use your Judgment ability to judge a creature, you gain the following benefit based on your order:

* **Exorcist:** You can teleport up to a number of squares equal to twice your Presence score. This movement must take you closer to the judged creature. You do not need line of effect to your destination.
* **Oracle:** You can deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to the judged creature.
* **Paragon:** You can vertical pull the judged creature up to a number of squares equal to twice your Presence score.

#### Kit

You can use and gain the benefits of a kit.see [Chapter 8: Kits](08-Kits.md) for more information. (*Quick Build:* Warrior Priest.)

#### My Life for Yours

You channel your will to mend your wounds or the wounds of your allies. You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">My Life for Yours</span>**

*You channel some of your vitality into more resilience for you or an ally.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |           **Triggered** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Trigger:** The target starts their turn or takes damage.

**Effect:** You spend a Recovery and the target regains Stamina equal to your recovery value.

**Spend 1 Wrath:** You can end one effect on the target that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of their turn, or a prone target can stand up.

#### 1st-Level Domain Feature

You gain a domain feature from your domain, as shown on the 1st-Level Censor Domain Features table. Additionally, you gain a skill from your domain, chosen from the skill group indicated on the table.

###### 1st-Level Censor Domain Features Table

| Domain     | Feature                       | Skill Group   |

| Trickery   | Inspired Deception            | Intrigue      |
| War        | Sanctified Weapon             | Exploration   |

##### Blessing of Compassion

You exude a magic presence that can soothe those willing to socially engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another creature with a test.

Additionally, when you are present at the start of a negotiation, one NPC of your choice has their patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5), and the first test made to influence them gains an edge.

##### Blessing of Comprehension

You can interpret diagrams and charts even if you don't understand the language associated with them. You are considered fluent in all languages for the purpose of understanding the project source for any crafting or research project (see [Chapter 15: Downtime Projects](15-Downtime-Projects.md)).

##### Blessing of Fortunate Weather

Each time you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions within 100 squares. Until you finish another respite, the weather conditions you establish follow you through any mundane outdoor locations. Choose one of the following types of weather, each of which grants a benefit to you and your allies:

**Clear:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Search or Navigate skills.

**Foggy:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Hide skill.

**Overcast:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Endurance skill.

**Precipitation:** When the ground is muddy or snowy, you and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Track skill.

If you are in the same area as a creature using this or a similar feature who has chosen a different weather effect, the features negate each other where their areas overlap.

##### Faithful Friend

You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Faithful Friend</span>**

*An animal spirit is drawn to you, sharing their senses with you and serving you faithfully.*

| **Magic**   | **Main action** |
| ----------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Self** |     **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The incorporeal animal has speed 5 and can fly, but can't physically interact with the world. While you are within 10 squares of the spirit, you automatically sense everything that type of animal would sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action required). If the spirit takes any damage, they are dismissed and you take 1d10 psychic damage that can't be reduced in any way.

##### Grave Speech

You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Grave Speech</span>**

*You commune with the lingering soul of the recently dead.*

| **Magic**      |             **Maneuver** |
| -------------- | -----------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1** | **🎯 One dead creature** |

**Effect:** You can speak to the target if they are a creature who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if they are just a head. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you. The trauma of dying can make a creature's memory of that event hazy, but the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the effect ends. You can't use this ability on the same creature twice.

##### Hands of the Maker

You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Hands of the Maker</span>**

*You craft objects with the power of your mind.*

| **Magic**   | **Maneuver** |
| ----------- | -----------: |
| **📏 Self** |  **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** You create a mundane object of size 1S or smaller. You can maintain a number of objects created this way equal to your Presence score. You can destroy an object created this way with a thought, no matter how far you are from it (no action required).

##### Inner Light

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. You place a ray of morning light into the chosen character's soul, granting them a +1 bonus to saving throws that lasts until you finish another respite.

##### Inspired Deception

The gods favor your thievery with magic. Whenever you make a test that uses a skill you have from the intrigue skill group, you can use Presence on the test instead of another characteristic.

##### Oracular Visions

Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points. Whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a test, you can spend 1 fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a respite.

##### Protective Circle

You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a protective circle on the ground large enough to hold one size 1 creature. The circle lasts for 24 hours, until you create another, or until you dismiss it (no action required). Only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle can enter and exit the area. While in the protective circle, a creature can't be targeted by strikes.

##### Revitalizing Ritual

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. The chosen character gains a bonus to their recovery value equal to your level that lasts until you finish another respite.

##### Sanctified Weapon

As a respite activity, you can bless a weapon. Any creature who wields the weapon gains a +1 bonus to rolled damage with abilities that use the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish another respite.

#### Censor Abilities

You use a blend of martial techniques and divine magic to attack your foes and defend your allies.

##### Signature Ability

Choose one signature ability from the following options. Signature abilities can be used at will. (*Quick Build:* Your Allies Cannot Save You!)

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Back Blasphemer!</span>**

*You channel power through your weapon to repel foes.*

| **Area, Magic, Melee, Weapon** |               **Main action** |

### 2nd-Level Features

As a 2nd-level censor, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one interpersonal, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.see [Chapter 9: Perks](09-Perks.md).

#### 2nd-Level Order Features

Your censor order grants you two features, as shown on the 2nd-Level Order Features table.

###### 2nd-Level Order Features Table

| Order    | Features                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Exorcist | Saint's Vigilance, A Sense for Truth |
| Oracle   | It Was Foretold, Judge of Character  |
| Paragon  | Lead by Example, Stalwart Icon       |

##### It Was Foretold

Your order has trained you to understand fragments of the visions granted to you by your deity, giving you a momentary advantage in challenging situations. At the start of an encounter, you can take one main action before any other creature and before your first turn. Additionally, whenever the Director calls for a montage test, you can make one free test before the montage begins, which counts as an earned success or failure as usual.

##### Judge of Character

Your focus on your fragmentary visions grants divine insight into the world and its creatures beyond your usual senses. Whenever you would make an Intuition test, you can make a Presence test instead.

##### Lead by Example

Your devotion to your deity allows you to take command of the battlefield, letting your allies benefit from your wisdom. While you are adjacent to a creature, your allies gain the benefits of flanking against that creature. Additionally, your allies gain an edge on tests made to aid other creatures with their tests.

##### Saint's Vigilance

You have honed your ability to detect sin and can use it to find those who hide from justice. Any creature judged by you can't use the Hide maneuver. Additionally, you gain an edge when searching for hidden creatures. If you find a hidden creature, you can use your Judgment ability against them as a free triggered action.

##### A Sense for Truth

You are trained in secret techniques from your order that allow you to discern the truth with supernatural precision. If a creature is of a lower level than you, you automatically know when they are lying, though you don't necessarily know the actual truth behind their lie. Additionally, you gain an edge on tests made to detect lies or hidden motives.

##### Stalwart Icon

You exhibit a small spark of your deity's power, causing creatures to trust or fear you, depending on what you need. You gain an edge on tests made to intimidate or persuade others.

#### 2nd-Level Order Ability

Your censor order grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.

The gods send divine favor to you and your allies. While you are not dying, enemies take a bane on strikes against you or any ally within 3 squares of you.

You can maintain bonds with up to three willing creatures using your Invocation of the Heart feature. Additionally, you have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Guided to Your Side</span>**

| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self and each ally** |

**Effect:** Each target is teleported to unoccupied spaces within 5 squares of a willing creature who you are bonded to with your Invocation of the Heart feature. You don't need line of effect to the bonded creature but you must be on the same world.

##### Divine Quartermaster

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose a treasure with a project goal equal to 50 times your level or less. You gain a divine version of this treasure that lasts until you finish another respite or it is consumed.

##### Font of Grace

Each time you use your My Life for Yours ability, you gain 1 wrath that can be spent only on that ability during the same turn. If you don't use this wrath, it is lost. Additionally, the target of My Life for Yours gains 10 temporary Stamina.

##### Gods' Library

You can gain access to information you need through prayer, so that you no longer require research materials for crafting and research projects (see [Chapter 15: Downtime Projects](15-Downtime-Projects.md)). Additionally, you add your level to project rolls you make for crafting and research projects. You also have any skills in the lore skill group you don't already have, and you gain a number of skills from any other skill groups equal to the number of skills you had in the lore skill group before you gained this feature.

##### Light of the Burning Sun

Sun infuses your body. Whenever you use an ability to deal rolled damage to another creature, that ability deals an extra 5 fire damage, or an extra 15 fire damage if the creature is undead. Additionally, you have fire immunity equal to your level, which is added to any other fire immunity you have.

##### Nature's Bounty

When you finish a respite, you can prepare a magic meal using local flora for any companions who rested with you. Choose two of the following benefits for creatures who consume the meal:

* Each creature gains immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage equal to your level. You can choose this benefit twice, choosing a different damage immunity each time.
* Each creature gains 20 temporary Stamina.

* Each creature gains a +1 bonus to saving throws.
* Each creature gains an edge on tests made to influence other creatures.

Each benefit lasts until the creature who gains it finishes another respite.

##### Ride the Lightning

Lightning and thunder infuse your body. Whenever you use an ability to deal rolled damage to another creature, the ability deals extra lightning damage equal to your Presence score. Additionally, if you use an ability that force moves a creature, the forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Presence score. While you are under the effect of your Windwalk feature, lightning enhances your locomotion to grant you a bonus to speed equal to your Might score. If Windwalk already grants you a bonus to speed, this bonus adds to that.

##### Trinity of Trickery

You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Trinity of Trickery (9 Wrath)</span>**

| ----------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** You create two illusory duplicates of the target, which appear anywhere within distance. These duplicates last until the end of the encounter. On each of their turns, the target can move each duplicate up to their speed. If the target is targeted by an ability, they can use a free triggered action to switch places with a duplicate within their line of effect, making the duplicate the target of the ability instead. When either duplicate takes damage, it is destroyed.

##### Word of Death Deferred

You can stop death from taking your allies. When an ally within distance of your My Life for Yours ability dies and you are not dying, you can use a free triggered action to instead have that ally fall unconscious until they regain Stamina.

Additionally, your abilities deal an extra 5 damage to winded creatures.

##### Word of Fate Denied

When an ally within 10 squares takes damage that would leave them dying, you can use a free triggered action to make yourself or another willing creature within 10 squares of you the target of the triggering damage instead. The creature you choose takes the damage and suffers any effects associated with it, and that damage can't be reduced in any way.

##### Your Triumphs Are Remembered

The gods allow you and your companions to bask in the glory of past successes. Whenever you finish a respite, you and any other heroes who rested with you regain 1 Victory after your Victories are converted to XP. This Victory isn't converted into XP at the end of a subsequent respite.

#### Focused Wrath

When you gain wrath at the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 3 wrath instead of 2.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.

### 8th-Level Features

As an 8th-level censor, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### 8th-Level Order Feature

Your censor order grants you a feature, as shown on the 8th-Level Order Features table.

###### 8th-Level Order Features Table

| -------- | ------------------- |
| Exorcist | Demonologist        |
| Oracle   | Their Past Revealed |
| Paragon  | Vow                 |

##### Demonologist

The most esoteric secrets of your order teach you that to defeat your enemy, you must understand them. You treat your Renown as 2 higher than usual when dealing with demons, devils, and other agents of chaos. If you successfully complete a negotiation with one of these creatures, you gain an edge on power rolls made against them and can use your Judgment ability against them as a free triggered action before an encounter begins.

##### Their Past Revealed

Your constant fragmentary visions become clearer, and can be honed to understand the past of creatures you interact with. While speaking with any creature, you can make a medium Presence test to see visions from their past. On a success, you see a clear view of any subject related to the creature's past that you wish to understand. On a success with a consequence, you see two visions, one false and one true. On a failure, you lose 2d6 Stamina.

##### Vow

Your words take on the power of your deity, with all the authority that entails. If you convince a creature to take an oath, they can't break it for 7 days. If you take an oath, you can't break it for 7 days.

#### 11-Wrath Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 11 wrath to use.

While banished, the target is sent to another manifold in the timescape and removed from the encounter map. A banished target can do nothing but make saving throws, and takes 10 holy damage each time they do so. If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina while banished, they are lost to the timescape.

### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level censor, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Might and Presence scores each increase to 5.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.

#### Templar

You are the ultimate representation of your god's justice in the timescape. Whenever you use your Judgment ability, you can use a free triggered action to use a conduit domain effect (see Domain Piety and Effects in the [Conduit](#conduit) section) associated with your chosen domain, or a domain you access with virtue (see below). If the effect calls for the use of your Intuition score, you use your Presence score instead. If the effect uses your conduit level, use your censor level instead.

Additionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must answer honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships your deity.

While you rest in their presence, your god might also give you priority targets to enact justice upon. You and your allies each have a double edge on power rolls made against such targets. If you attempt to open a portal to your deity again before you have defeated your priority targets, you suffer your god's wrath, as determined by the Director.

#### Virtue

You have an epic resource called virtue. Each time you finish a respite, you gain virtue equal to the XP you gain. You can spend virtue on your abilities as if it were wrath.

Additionally, you can spend 3 virtue to access one of your deity's domains that you usually don't have access to. When you do, you can use that domain's features until you finish another respite.

Virtue remains until you spend it.

#### Wrath of the Gods

When you gain wrath at the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 4 wrath instead of 3.

## Conduit

The power of the gods flows through you! As a vessel for divine power, you don't just keep your allies in the fight. You make those allies more effective, even as you rain divine energy down upon your foes. Though the deity or saint you serve might have other faithful and clergy, you are special among worshippers, receiving your abilities from the highest source.

**As a conduit, you heal and buff your allies, and debuff your foes while smiting them with divine magic. The spark of divinity within you shines, filling your enemies with awe and making you more worldly and aware.**

> "The gods judge our actions, and our inaction."
>
> **Dazar**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with an Intuition of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

* 2, 2, −1, −1
* 2, 1, 1, −1
* 2, 1, 0, 0
* 1, 1, 1, 0

**Weak Potency:** Intuition - 2

**Average Potency:** Intuition - 1

**Strong Potency:** Intuition

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 6

**Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** Choose any two skills from the interpersonal or lore skill groups (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). (*Quick Build:* Read Person, Religion.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a conduit, you gain the following features.

#### Deity and Domains

Choose a god or saint who your character reveres from Chapter 14: Gods and Religion, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity and choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick two domains from their portfolio. The two domains you pick make up your subclass, and your choice of domains determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels. (*Quick Build:* Adûn for deity, and Life and Protection as domains.)

#### Piety

Your deity grants you a Heroic Resource called piety, letting you heal and empower your allies, and unleash holy power upon your foes.

##### Piety in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain piety equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 piety.

Additionally, you can gain more piety by praying to the gods—but beware! Doing so can easily draw their ire, as the gods hate to be annoyed. Before you roll to gain piety at the start of your turn, you can pray (no action required). If you do, your roll gains the following additional effects:

* If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional piety but anger the gods! You take psychic damage equal to 1d6 + your level, which can't be reduced in any way.
* If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 additional piety.
* If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 additional piety and can activate a domain effect of your choice (see below).

You lose any remaining piety at the end of the encounter.

##### Piety Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain piety outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost piety without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs piety, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect, such as Healing Grace, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of piety equal to your Victories.

##### Domain Piety and Effects

Your choice of domains provides you with two additional ways to earn piety during combat, as triggered by specific events. You might even have a single event trigger both your piety effects. For example, the Sun domain grants piety when a nearby creature takes fire or holy damage, while the War domain grants piety when a nearby creature takes damage of 10 + your level or higher. If you have both those domains and a nearby creature takes an appropriate amount of fire damage, you gain piety from both your domains.

Additionally, whenever you activate a domain effect by praying for piety, you can choose one of your domains and have that domain's prayer effect take effect immediately.

###### Creation Domain Piety and Effect

* **Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares uses an area ability.

###### Knowledge Domain Piety and Effect

* **Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that the Director spends Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*).

Alternatively, you or one ally within 10 squares gains temporary Stamina equal to two times your Intuition score.

* **Prayer Effect:** One ally within 10 squares gains temporary Stamina equal to four times your Intuition score.

###### Storm Domain Piety and Effect

* **Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that an enemy within 10 squares is force moved.

##### Blessing of Compassion

You exude a magic presence that can soothe those willing to socially engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another creature with a test.

Additionally, when you are present at the start of a negotiation, one NPC of your choice has their patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5), and the first test made to influence them gains an edge.

##### Blessing of Comprehension

You can interpret diagrams and charts even if you don't understand the language associated with them. You are considered fluent in all languages for the purpose of understanding the project source for any research or crafting project (see Chapter 12: Downtime Projects).

##### Blessing of Fortunate Weather

Each time you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions within 100 squares. Until you finish another respite, the weather conditions you establish follow you through any mundane outdoor locations. Choose one of the following types of weather, each of which grants a benefit to you and your allies:

**Clear:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Search or Navigate skills.

**Foggy:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Hide skill. **Overcast:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Endurance skill.

**Precipitation:** When the ground is muddy or snowy, you and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Track skill.

If you are in the same area as a creature using this or a similar feature who has chosen a different weather effect, the features negate each other where their areas overlap.

##### Faithful Friend

You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Faithful Friend</span>**

**Effect:** You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The incorporeal animal has speed 5 and can fly, but can't physically interact with the world. While you are within 10 squares of the spirit, you automatically sense everything that type of animal would sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action required). If the spirit takes any damage, they are dismissed and you take 1d10 psychic damage that can't be reduced in any way.

| **📏 Melee 1** | **🎯 One dead creature** |

**Effect:** You can speak to the target if they are a creature who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if they are just a head. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you. The trauma of dying can make a creature's memory of that event hazy, but the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the effect ends. You can't use this ability on the same creature twice.

##### Hands of the Maker

You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Hands of the Maker</span>**

##### Oracular Visions

Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points. Whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a test, you can spend 1 fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a respite.

##### Protective Circle

You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a protective circle on the ground large enough to hold one size 1 creature. The circle lasts for 24 hours, until you create another, or until you dismiss it (no action required). Only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle can enter and exit the area. While in the protective circle, a creature can't be targeted by strikes.

##### Revitalizing Ritual

## Elementalist

Air for movement. Earth for permanence. Fire for destruction. Water for change. Green for growth. Rot for death. Void for the mystery that which cannot be known. Years of study and practice and poring over tomes brought you the revelations that allow you to manipulate these building blocks of reality. Now you use your mastery of the seven elements to destroy, create, and warp the world with magic.

**As an elementalist, you can unleash your wrath across a field of foes, debilitate enemies, ward yourself and allies, manipulate terrain, warp space, and more. Your elemental specialization determines which of these talents you excel at.**

> "Understanding the mystery, requires ignorance of the mystery."
>
> **Embers**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Reason of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

* 2, 2, −1, −1
* 2, 1, 1, −1
* 2, 1, 0, 0
* 1, 1, 1, 0

**Weak Potency:** Reason − 2

**Average Potency:** Reason − 1

**Strong Potency:** Reason

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 6

**Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** You gain the Magic skill (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any three skills from the crafting or lore skill groups. (*Quick Build:* Alchemy, Blacksmithing, History, Magic.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Elemental Specialization

Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the seven primal elements of the timescape:

* **Air** is the element of movement. Air abilities allow you to manipulate speed, quickness, flight, and breath.
* **Earth** is the element of permanence. Earth abilities bolster your body and grant the power to permanently create and shape physical terrain.
* **Fire** is the element of destruction. Fire abilities devastate enemies and melt objects to slag.
* **Green** is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies.
* **Rot** is the element of decay. Rot abilities harm and debuff enemies.
* **Void** is the element of the mystery. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to teleport, create illusions, and make things incorporeal.
* **Water** is the element of change. Water abilities enhance your allies' power, and alter your enemies' power for the worse.

You choose an elemental specialization from the following options: earth, fire, green, or void. Your elemental specialization is your subclass, and your choice of specialization determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels, including one of the following benefits. (Other elemental specializations will be featured in future products.) (*Quick Build:* Fire.)

##### Earth: Acolyte of Earth

You harness the flow of earth magic to become harder to move. Whenever you use an ability that has the Earth and Magic keywords, your stability increases by 1 until the start of your next turn. This benefit is cumulative.

##### Fire: Acolyte of Fire

You become an expert at wielding destructive flames. Your abilities that have the Fire and Magic keywords gain a +1 bonus to rolled damage. Your Hurl Element ability (see below) also gains this bonus when you use it to deal fire damage.

##### Green: Acolyte of the Green

You harness the residual magic from your green spells to bolster yourself and your allies. Whenever you deal damage to one or more creatures using an ability that has the Green and Magic keywords and that costs essence to use (see below), you or one creature within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to your Reason score.

##### Void: Acolyte of the Mystery

You use your immersion in the mystery of void magic to expand the reach of that magic better than other mages. The distance of all your abilities that have the Magic, Ranged, and Void keywords increases by 2 squares.

#### Essence

You channel the substance of creation in the form of a Heroic Resource called essence, gathering and burning it to cast and maintain spells.

##### Essence in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain essence equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 essence.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that you or a creature within 10 squares takes damage that isn't untyped or holy damage, you gain 1 essence.

You lose any remaining essence at the end of the encounter.

##### Essence Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain essence outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost essence without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs essence, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use a persistent ability outside of combat (see Persistent Magic below), you can maintain it for a number of rounds equal to your Victories.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited essence on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of essence equal to your Victories.

#### Hurl Element

You have the following ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Hurl Element</span>**

*You cast a ball of elemental energy at a foe.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Strike** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**          | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

* **≤11:**  2 + `▏R▕` damage
* **12-16:**  4 + `▏R▕` damage
* **17+:**  6 + `▏R▕` damage

**Effect:** When you make this strike, choose the damage type from one of the following options: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.

#### Persistent Magic

Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry. For example, the Instantaneous Excavation ability has an effect noted as "Persistent 1." Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to maintain it, and start doing so immediately after you first use the ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent effect. All your active persistent abilities end at the end of the encounter.

You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn. You can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action required).

If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a persistent ability.

If you take damage equal to or greater than 5 times your Reason score in one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For instance, if you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining Instantaneous Excavation, taking 10 or more damage in one turn causes you to stop maintaining the ability.

#### Practical Magic

You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Practical Magic</span>**

*Your mastery of elemental power lets you customize your conjurations.*

| **Magic**              | **Maneuver** |
| ---------------------- | -----------: |
| **📏 Self; see below** |  **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:

* You use the Knockback maneuver (see Chapter 10: Combat), but its distance becomes the range of your Hurl Element ability, and you use Reason instead of Might for the power roll.
* You choose a creature within the distance of your Hurl Element ability and one of the following damage types: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic. That creature takes damage of the chosen type equal to your Reason score.
* You teleport up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If you choose this option, you can spend essence to teleport 1 additional square for each essence spent.

#### 1st-Level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 1st-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

###### 1st-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature                    |

| Fire           | Return to Formlessness     |
| Green          | It Is the Soul Which Hears |

| **📏 Ranged 10**        | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** For each Victory you have, you can target one creature. Each target gains the benefit of your A Beyonding of Vision feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of the Shared Void Sense ability.

##### It Is the Soul Which Hears

You can speak with and understand animals, beasts, and plant creatures, even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate with these creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent, but you can use Reason instead of Presence while making tests to influence them.

Additionally, you can touch a living plant that is not a plant creature to communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and sensations that can't be overly specific.

You can instead touch an existing doorway or other opening that is 1 square or smaller in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface. The opening is sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.

##### Return to Formlessness

You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Return to Formlessness</span>**

*With the merest touch, you cause an object to turn to slag or ash.*

| **Fire, Magic, Melee** |           **Main action** |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**         | **🎯 One mundane object** |

**Effect:** You heat the target and cause it to melt or combust, destroying it. If the object is larger than 1 square, then only the square of the object you touch is destroyed.

* **≤11:** 4 fire damage
* **12-16:** 6 fire damage
* **17+:** 10 fire damage

**Persistent 2:** At the start of your turn, you can use a maneuver to use this ability again without spending essence.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Instantaneous Excavation (5 Essence)</span>**

*The surface of the world around you opens up to swallow foes.*

| **Earth, Magic, Ranged** |   **Maneuver** |
| ------------------------ | -------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**         | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** You open up two holes with 1-square openings that are 4 squares deep, which can be placed on any mundane surface within distance. You can place these holes next to each other to create fewer holes with wider openings. When the holes open, make a separate power roll for each creature on the ground above a hole and small enough to fall in. (You can't score a critical hit with this ability because it uses a maneuver.)

**Power Roll + Reason:**

* **≤11:** The target can shift 1 square from the edge of the hole to the nearest unoccupied space of their choice.
* **12-16:** The target falls into the hole.
* **17+:** The target falls into the hole and can't reduce the height of the fall.

**Persistent 1:** At the start of your turn, you open another hole, making a power roll against each creature who could fall into the hole when it opens without spending essence.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">No More Than a Breeze (5 Essence)</span>**

*The material substance of a creature shreds away at your command.*

| ----------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**        | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the target can move through solid matter, they ignore difficult terrain, and their movement can't provoke opportunity attacks. If the target ends their turn inside solid matter, they are forced out into the space where they entered it and this effect ends.

**Persistent 1:** The effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Test of Rain (5 Essence)</span>**

*You call down a rain that burns your enemies and restores your allies.*

**Power Roll + Reason:**

* **≤11:** 4 acid damage
* **12-16:** 6 acid damage
* **17+:** 10 acid damage

**Effect:** You can end one effect on yourself that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your turn. Each ally in the area also gains this benefit.

### 2nd-Level Features

As a 2nd-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice. See Chapter 7: Perks.

#### 2nd-Level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 2nd-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

###### 2nd-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Earth          | Disciple of Earth         |
| Fire           | Disciple of Fire          |
| Green          | Disciple of the Green     |
| Void           | There Is No Space Between |

##### Disciple of Earth

Your body is strengthened by your mind's connection to the element of permanence. You have a +6 bonus to Stamina, and you gain an additional +3 bonus to Stamina whenever you gain a level past 2nd.

##### Disciple of Fire

Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it, even as you rip away the protections of others. You have fire immunity equal to 5 plus your level. Additionally, fire damage you deal ignores a target's fire immunity.

At the start of a combat encounter, you gain a number of surges equal to your Victories. Whenever you spend a surge to deal extra damage, you can make that damage fire damage.

##### Disciple of the Green

You can use a maneuver to shapeshift into a type of creature on the Green Animal Forms table. While in animal form, you can speak, and you use your Reason score to make melee free strikes. Your statistics stay the same except as noted on the table.

Each form has a prerequisite level that you must attain before you can adopt it. Some animal forms grant you temporary Stamina. You lose this temporary Stamina when you revert back to your true form.

You choose a specific animal and appearance while in animal form. For example, if you become a rodent, you might become a mouse, a rat, a shrew, or any other size 1T animal who fits the rodent type. When you take on an animal form, your equipment either melds into your new form or falls undamaged to the ground (your choice). When you return to your true form, any melded gear reappears on your person.

You can revert back to your true form as a maneuver. You can't enter an animal form unless you are in your true form. When you are dying, you revert to your true form and can't turn back into an animal until you are no longer dying.

##### There Is No Space Between

You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">There Is No Space Between</span>**

*Knowledge of the mystery reveals that two spaces are the same space.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Void** |   **Maneuver** |
| ----------------------- | -------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**        | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** You open two size 1 portals in unoccupied spaces within distance, which last until you move beyond distance from any portal, end the effect as a maneuver, or are dying. Each portal must be placed at a height of no more than 1 square above the ground. When you or any ally touch a portal, that creature can choose to be instantly teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice adjacent to the other portal. If an enemy is force moved into a portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an unoccupied space chosen by the creature who force moved them.

At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active, you can open a new portal connected to the others. If three or more portals are present, you and your allies choose which portal to emerge from when entering a portal, and a creature who force moves an enemy into a portal chooses that enemy's destination portal.

#### New 5-Essence Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 5 essence to use. Alternatively, you can choose one of the 5-essence abilities you didn't select at 1st level (see 1st-Level Features).

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">O Flower Aid, O Earth Defend (5 Essence)</span>**

*Revitalizing plants and jagged stones grow, helping allies and hindering foes.*

| **Area, Earth, Green, Magic, Ranged** |   **Maneuver** |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------: |
| **📏 3 cube within 10**               | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the area gains the following effects:

* Once as a free maneuver at the start of your turn, you allow yourself and each ally in the area to spend any number of Recoveries.
* The area is difficult terrain for enemies.
* Each enemy who enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there takes damage equal to your Reason score.

**Persistent 1:** The area remains until the start of your next turn. As a maneuver, you can move the area up to 5 squares. This ability ends if the area is ever not within your line of effect.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Subvert the Green Within (5 Essence)</span>**

*Fungal spores sprout inside your enemy's brain, allowing you to control their actions.*

| **Green, Magic, Ranged, Strike, Void** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                       | **🎯 One creature** |

| Fire           | The Flame Primordial   |
| Green          | Chimeric Manifestation |
| Void           | Black Hole Star        |

##### Black Hole Star

You warp gravity around your heavenly body and can pull even the sturdiest titans toward your core. At the end of each of your turns, you target one creature or object within distance of your Hurl Element ability and vertical pull that target up to 5 squares. If their stability reduces this forced movement, they are pulled a minimum of 2 squares. This forced movement ignores stability for your allies.

Additionally, your Mantle of Essence improves. While in the area of the aura, enemies and objects have their stability reduced by an amount equal to your level.

##### Chimeric Manifestation

Nature isn't static and unchanging, and neither are you. You can enter or exit your animal form as a free maneuver the first time you use your Disciple of the Green feature on your turn.

Additionally, whenever you use your Disciple of the Green feature, you can select an additional animal form and gain the positive benefits from both forms. You can choose the size of either animal, and if both animal forms grant you the same benefit, you can choose whichever you prefer. You gain the highest speed between the two animal forms and have all types of movement from both forms.

You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or less. For example, you can combine a shark (8th level) with a horse (4th level), but you can't combine a shark with a bear (5th level).

##### The Flame Primordial

You produce a fire that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or object, they take an extra 1d6 fire damage. If you deal fire damage to a mundane object, you can use a free triggered action to target it with your Return to Formlessness ability instead.

Additionally, any enemy who starts their turn adjacent to you has fire weakness equal to your Reason score until the start of their next turn. This increases to twice your Reason score if the enemy is made of or is wearing mostly metal.

You have mastered the magic of shaping a wyrd, and can use your Wyrding feature as a main action.

While the shield is active, the target can take the Defend main action as a maneuver on each of their turns. The target gains 30 temporary Stamina that lasts until depleted or until the effect ends. If this temporary Stamina disappears, the effect ends and the shield explodes, dealing 10 damage to each enemy within 5 squares of the target.

**Persistent 2:** The effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

* **17+:**  25 + `▏R▕` fire damage; `▏I▕` < `▏STRONG▕`, dazed (save ends)

**Effect:** This damage ignores immunity.

### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Breath

You have an epic resource called breath. Each time you finish a respite, you gain breath equal to the XP you gain. You can spend any number of breath to gain essence (no action required). When you do, 1 breath becomes 3 essence.

Breath remains until you convert it to essence.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Reason score increases to 5. Additionally, you can increase one of your characteristic scores by 1, to a maximum of 5.

#### Essential Being

When you gain essence at the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 4 essence instead of 3.

#### One

You become the embodiment of the element of your chosen specialization. Whenever you use magic, elemental motes flit around you and your skin changes to reflect your element, taking on an earthen or stony appearance for earth, appearing like flickering flame for fire, gaining a leaf pattern for green, and becoming a starry expanse for void. Additionally, you gain one of the following benefits, as shown on the One Specialization Features table.

###### One Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature         |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Earth          | Master of Earth |
| Fire           | Master of Fire  |
| Green          | Master of Green |
| Void           | Master of Void  |

##### Master of Earth

You have damage immunity 5.

Additionally, as a respite activity, you can shape the mundane earth around you in a 1-mile radius. You can open sinkholes, form mountains, level mundane structures or whole settlements, create canyons, raise islands or sink them in the sea, and perform similar feats. You can't use this respite activity if another creature within 1 mile is already using it. Once you use this respite activity, you can't use it again for 10 days.

##### Master of Fire

The damage bonus of your Acolyte of Fire feature increases to +5 and applies to all your magic abilities.

Additionally, your Return to Formlessness ability can be used on supernatural objects (but not on artifacts). When you melt a treasure (see Chapter 13: Rewards), you gain breath equal to its echelon.

##### Master of Green

The number of Recoveries you have increases by 2, and each time you finish a respite, you can grant each ally who finished the respite with you 2 additional Recoveries. Your allies' additional Recoveries disappear when they finish their next respite.

Additionally, as a respite activity, you can perform a ritual that causes a fruit tree to spring from the ground, grow, mature, and produce 1d6 of a treasure called Life Fruit. You can use a respite activity to cause an existing tree to produce another 1d6 Life Fruit, but it does not grow these magic consumables on its own.

As a maneuver, a creature can consume a Life Fruit or feed it to an adjacent willing ally. When a creature eats a Life Fruit, they restore all their Stamina, they can end all conditions or effects on themself, and they can stand up if prone. Additionally, if the creature desires, their aging pauses for 1d10 years. If the creature eats additional Life Fruit and chooses to pause their aging, the effects don't stack. Instead, the creature gains the benefit from the Life Fruit that pauses their aging for the longest time.

##### Master of Void

Whenever you willingly move, you can teleport.

Additionally, your mind is connected to the mystery and helps you find the answers you seek. You no longer require project sources for research projects. Whenever you use a respite activity to make a project roll for a research project, you automatically complete the project.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.

## Fury

You do not temper the heat of battle within you. You unleash it! Your experience in the wild taught you the secrets of predators, and now, like the raptor, the panther, the wolf, you channel unfettered anger into martial prowess. Primordial Chaos is your ally. Let others use finesse to clean up the wreckage left in your wake.

**As a fury, you devastate foes with overwhelming might, hurl yourself and enemies around the battlefield, and grow stronger as your ferocity increases. Nature has no concept of fairness—and neither do you.**

> "DEATH!"
>
> **Khorva**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Might of 2 and an Agility of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

* 2, −1, −1
* 1, 1, −1
* 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Might − 2

**Average Potency:** Might − 1

**Strong Potency:** Might

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 21

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 9

**Recoveries:** 10

**Skills:** You gain the Nature skill (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any two skills from the exploration or intrigue skill groups. (*Quick Build:* Alertness, Jump, Nature.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level fury, you gain the following features.

#### Primordial Aspect

You are a product of customs older than warfare, older than civilization, older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage that revealed the building blocks of the timescape—the Primordial Chaos—and that left an aspect of that chaos inside you. You choose a primordial aspect from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Berserker.)

* **Berserker:** You channel your ferocity into physical might, acting as a living version of the forces that shape the world. You have the Lift skill.
* **Reaver:** You channel your ferocity into instinct and cunning, challenging the order of civilization. You have the Hide skill.
* **Stormwight:** You channel your ferocity into primordial storms and can take on the form of an animal or an animal hybrid form. You have the Track skill.

Your primordial aspect is your subclass, and your choice of aspect determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

#### Ferocity

Within the heat of battle, your determination and anger grow, fueling a Heroic Resource called ferocity.

> **Where's My Maneuver?**
>
> Since most other classes get a bespoke maneuver, you might find yourself asking, "Where's the special maneuver for the fury?" The answer is that the class doesn't need its own maneuver, because most of the time, the fantasy of the fury has them using the Grab or Knockback maneuvers in combat. They're really good at those maneuvers too, so it doesn't make sense to give you another option that you'll rarely or never use.

##### Ferocity in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain ferocity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 ferocity.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that you take damage, you gain 1 ferocity. The first time you become winded or are dying in an encounter, you gain 1d3 ferocity.

You lose any remaining ferocity at the end of the encounter.

##### Ferocity Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain ferocity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost ferocity without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs ferocity, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited ferocity on its effect, such as To the Uttermost End, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of ferocity equal to your Victories.

#### Growing Ferocity

You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of ferocity you have (see 1st-Level Aspect Features for details). These benefits last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of ferocity you spend during your turn.

Some Growing Ferocity benefits can be applied only if you are a specific level or higher, with the level of those benefits noted in the various Growing Ferocity tables in this section.

###### Berserker Growing Ferocity Table

| 12 (10th level) | Whenever you use a heroic ability, you gain 10 temporary Stamina. Additionally, whenever you make a power roll that imposes forced movement on a target, the forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Might score. |

Additionally, you automatically sense any source of one of those damage types within 10 squares, such as a fire or a source of elemental power.

#### Primordial Strike

You can manifest your ferocity directly as an elemental force created by the Primordial Chaos. As part of any strike, you can spend 1 ferocity to gain 1 surge that must be used for that strike.

This stacks with the increase to your effective Renown provided by the Nature's Knight aspect feature (see 3rd-Level Features). When any elemental first becomes aware of you in combat, if they have `▏P▕` < `▏AVERAGE▕`, they are frightened of you (save ends).

#### Primordial Portal

As a main action, you can touch a magic source of elemental power and use it to create a portal to Quintessence. You can then use a main action to teleport yourself and any willing creatures within 10 squares of you through the portal and onto a safe island in Quintessence, or to teleport back again. You can maintain a number of portals equal to your Might score, each leading to the same safe island in Quintessence. If a portal in your network is destroyed, it is no longer part of the network.

## Null

The mind is not separate from the body. Perfection of one requires perfection of the other. You strive for perfect discipline, perfect order, mastery over mind and body, becoming an unarmed psionic warrior who dampens and absorbs magic and psionics. You require no weapons, no tools. You suffice.

**As a null, you resist the supernatural forces of the universe with composure and confidence. As you strive for perfect order, you are an enemy of the ultimate expression of chaos: the supernatural. Those who break the laws of nature using sorcery or psionics should fear you.**

> "Any weapon can be turned against the hand that wields it."
>
> **Ardashir**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with an Agility of 2 and an Intuition of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

* 2, −1, −1
* 1, 1, −1
* 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Intuition − 2

**Average Potency:** Intuition − 1

**Strong Potency:** Intuition

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 21

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 9

**Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** You gain the Psionics skill (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any two skills from the interpersonal or lore skill groups. (*Quick Build:* Psionics, Read Person, Timescape.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level null, you gain the following features.

#### Null Tradition

Through extensive physical and psionic training, you have learned to unlock the full potential of your body. As you shape the growth of your power, you choose a null tradition from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Chronokinetic and the Monsters skill.)

* **Chronokinetic:** Your training unmoors you from temporal reality, allowing you to use the flow of time as another dimension that all things move through. You gain one skill from the lore group.
* **Cryokinetic:** You can tap into absolute cold, the most essential energy of myriad manifolds, and manifest its effects in your body. You gain one skill from the crafting group.
* **Metakinetic:** You learn to see through the illusions of the universe to more fully understand your body and its psionic potential. You gain one skill from the exploration group.

Your null tradition is your subclass, and your choice of tradition determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

#### Discipline

As your mastery of your body and tradition grows, it imbues you with a Heroic Resource called discipline.

##### Discipline in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain discipline equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 discipline.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that an enemy in the area of your Null Field ability (see below) uses a main action, you gain 1 discipline. The first time each combat round that the Director uses an ability that costs Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*), you gain 1 discipline.

You lose any remaining discipline at the end of the encounter.

##### Discipline Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain discipline outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost discipline without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs discipline, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited discipline on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of discipline equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the null, but they might appear in future products.)

#### Null Field

You project a psionic field of order around your body, dampening the effects of supernatural abilities harmful to you and your allies.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Null Field</span>**

*You project an aura that dampens the power of your foes.*

| **Area, Psionic** |                  **Maneuver** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 1 aura**     | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** Each target reduces their potencies by 1.

Once as a free maneuver on each of your turns, you can spend 1 discipline and give your Null Field one of the following additional effects until the start of your next turn:

* Gravitic Disruption: The first time on a turn that a target takes damage, you can slide them up to 2 squares.
* Inertial Anchor: Any target who starts their turn in the area can't shift.
* Synaptic Break: Whenever you or any ally uses an ability against a target that has a potency effect, the potency is increased by 1.

This ability remains active even after an encounter ends. It ends only if you are dying or if you willingly end it (no action required).

#### Inertial Shield

Your instincts for danger let you predict attacks before they happen.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Inertial Shield</span>**

*You intuit the course of an incoming attack, reducing its effects.*

| **Psionic** | **Triggered** |
| ----------- | ------------: |
| **📏 Self** |   **🎯 Self** |

**Trigger:** You take damage.

**Effect:** You take half the damage.

**Spend 1 Discipline:** The potency of one effect associated with the damage is reduced by 1 for you.

#### Discipline Mastery

As you advance in your chosen null tradition, you gain certain benefits in combat, including benefits based on the amount of discipline you have. Benefits based on how much discipline you have last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of discipline you spend during your turn.

Some Discipline Mastery benefits can be applied only if you are a specific level or higher, with the level of those benefits noted in the tables below.

##### Chronokinetic Mastery

Whenever you use the Inertial Shield ability, you can use the Disengage move action as a free triggered action.

Additionally, as your discipline grows, your psionic mastery of your body intensifies, granting benefits from the Chronokinetic Mastery table. Benefits are cumulative except where an improved benefit replaces a lesser benefit.

## Shadow

Subtlety is your art, the tip of the blade your brush. You studied at a secret college, specializing in alchemy, illusion, or shadow-magics. Your training and knowledge place you among the elite ranks of assassins, spies, and commandos. But more potent than any weapon or sorcery is your insight into your enemies' weaknesses.

**As a shadow, you possess abilities that deal significant damage, enable you to move swiftly across the battlefield and evade hazards, and allow you to fade from notice even in the midst of the most intense combat encounters. You also possess more skills than any other hero.**

"Whenever there is doubt, there is no doubt." **Motto of the College of Black Ash**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with an Agility of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

* 2, 2, −1, −1
* 2, 1, 1, −1
* 2, 1, 0, 0
* 1, 1, 1, 0

**Weak Potency:** Agility − 2

**Average Potency:** Agility − 1

**Strong Potency:** Agility

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 6

**Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** You gain the Hide and Sneak skills (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any five skills from Criminal Underworld or the skills of the exploration, interpersonal, or intrigue skill groups. (*Quick Build:* Criminal Underworld, Hide, Lie, Pick Lock, Pick Pocket, Sabotage, Sneak.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level shadow, you gain the following features.

#### Shadow College

Shadow colleges are secret institutions that turn ordinary folk into something else. Finding a college is the first step in a rigorous initiation process that tests the mettle of an applicant. Even those who make the cut often wash out—or are kicked out—as the master shadows who teach stealth, magic, and assassination to their students are often less than gentle in their approach.

You graduated from a shadow college chosen from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* College of Black Ash.)

* College of Black Ash: The College of Black Ash founded the art of being a shadow. Its graduates are unmatched in mobility, using sorcery to teleport around the battlefield, manipulate shadows, and summon darkness. You have the Magic skill.
* College of Caustic Alchemy: The College of Caustic Alchemy teaches its students recipes for the acids, bombs, and poisons used in their grim work. Graduates of the college are exceptional assassins. You have the Alchemy skill.
* College of the Harlequin Mask: Graduates of the College of the Harlequin Mask learn illusion magic, which they use to infiltrate enemy strongholds and create orchestrated chaos in combat. You have the Lie skill.

Your shadow college is your subclass, and your choice of college determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

#### Insight

By observing your enemy, you learn how to use their weaknesses against them, building up a Heroic Resource called insight.

##### Insight in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain insight equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 insight.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that you deal damage incorporating 1 or more surges, you gain 1 insight.

Whenever you use a heroic ability that makes use of a power roll, that ability costs 1 fewer insight if you have an edge or double edge on it. If the ability has multiple targets, the cost is reduced even if the ability gains an edge or has a double edge against only one target.

You lose any remaining insight at the end of the encounter.

##### Insight Outside of Combat

Although you can't gain insight outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost insight without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs insight, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of insight equal to your Victories.

#### 1st-Level College Features

Your shadow college grants you one or two features, as shown on the 1st-Level College Features table.

While this illusion lasts, your strikes gain an edge, and when you take the Disengage move action, you gain a +1 bonus to the distance you can shift.

The illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you physically interact with a creature, when you use this ability again, or when you end the illusion (no action required). If you end this illusion by harming another creature, you gain 1 surge.

**Spend 1 Insight:** Choose a creature whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours and who is within 10 squares. This ability's illusion makes you appear as that creature. This illusion covers your entire body, including clothing and armor, and alters your voice to sound like that of the creature. You gain an edge on tests made to convince the creature's allies that you are the creature.

##### Smoke Bomb

You always carry a supply of smoke bombs to use for distractions and easy getaways. You can use the Hide maneuver even if you are observed and don't initially have cover or concealment. When you do so, you can shift a number of squares equal to your Agility score. If you end this movement with cover or concealment, you are automatically hidden.

At the start of each of your turns, you can forgo gaining insight to create 1d6 clones of yourself in unoccupied adjacent spaces. A clone acts on your turn and uses your statistics, except they have 1 Stamina. They are affected by any conditions and effects on you, and last until the start of your next turn. A clone doesn't have insight and can't use the Careful Observation ability, the Umbral Form feature, or any triggered actions. On their turn, a clone has a move action, a maneuver, and a main action that they can use only to make a free strike. While making a free strike, a clone must choose targets that you or another clone aren't also striking.

Additionally, you are always wreathed in darkness that grants you concealment while in this form, and creatures no longer gain an edge on strikes against you.

While you are in your umbral form, you can spend 1 uninterrupted minute concentrating on a location where you've been before.

## Tactician

Strategist. Defender. Leader. With weapon in hand, you lead allies into the maw of battle, barking out commands that inspire your fellow heroes to move faster and strike more precisely. All the while, you stand between your compatriots and death, taunting the followers of evil to best you if they can.

**As a tactician, you have abilities that heal your allies and grant them increased damage, movement, and attacks, even as you leave your enemies struggling to respond.**

> "Your line is broken, Varrox! Your wizard is dead. Hahah! You should have negotiated!"
>
> **Sir John of Tor**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Might of 2 and a Reason of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

* 2, −1, −1
* 1, 1, −1
* 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Reason − 2

**Average Potency:** Reason − 1

**Strong Potency:** Reason

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 21

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 9

**Skills:** You gain the Lead skill (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any two skills from Alertness, Architecture, Blacksmithing, Brag, Culture, Empathize, Fletching, Mechanics, Monsters, Search, Strategy, or the skills of the exploration skill group. (*Quick Build:* Lead, Monsters, Strategy.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level tactician, you gain the following features.

#### Tactical Doctrine

Warfare is as old as civilization—and perhaps even older. As battle became ever more complex, military leaders invented tactical doctrine, outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed. Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield. Whatever path brought you to your mastery of historically proven tactics, you choose a tactical doctrine from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Vanguard and the Intimidate skill.)

* **Insurgent:** Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in battle is your opponent's job. You'll do whatever it takes to keep your allies alive. You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.
* **Mastermind:** You have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing the battlefield as a game board and seeking victory by thinking steps ahead of your opponents. You gain a skill from the lore skill group.
* **Vanguard:** You have learned the stratagems of ancient heroes, letting you lead from the front lines and seek victory through sheer force of will and personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal skill group.

Your tactical doctrine is your subclass, and your choice of doctrine determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

#### Focus

The ring of steel panics others but brings order to your mind, granting you a Heroic Resource called focus.

##### Focus in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain focus equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 focus.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that you or any ally damages a creature marked by you (see Mark below), you gain 1 focus. The first time in a combat round that any ally within 10 squares of you uses a heroic ability, you gain 1 focus.

You lose any remaining focus at the end of the encounter.

##### Focus Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain focus outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost focus without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs focus, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited focus on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of focus equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the tactician, but they might appear in future products.)

> **Tactician Abilities Explained**
>
> Many of the tactician's abilities grant allies extra movement, damage, and actions. But what's happening in the fiction to allow this? The tactician is an incredible strategist and inspiring leader who is quick to give commands and inspiration that causes their allies to act. The tactician can quickly read the battlefield, analyze enemies, and then bark orders and encouragement that pushes their allies to greatness. Many of the names of the tactician's abilities are the actual commands they give their friends!

#### 1st-Level Doctrine Feature

Your tactical doctrine grants you a feature, as shown on the 1st-Level Doctrine Features table.

###### 1st-Level Doctrine Features Table

| Doctrine   | Feature             |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Insurgent  | Covert Operations   |
| Mastermind | Studied Commander   |
| Vanguard   | Commanding Presence |

##### Commanding Presence

You command any room you walk into. While you are present during a negotiation, each hero with you treats their Renown as 2 higher than usual. Additionally, each hero with you during a combat encounter has a double edge on tests made to stop combat and start a negotiation.

##### Covert Operations

While in your presence or working according to your plans, each of your allies gains an edge on tests using any skill from the intrigue skill group. Additionally, you can use the Lead skill to assist another creature with any test made using a skill from the intrigue group.

At the Director's discretion, you and your allies can use skills from the intrigue skill group to attempt research or reconnaissance during a negotiation instead of outside of a negotiation.

##### Studied Commander

Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that knowledge to current challenges. While you are present, each hero with you treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one category cheaper. This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such projects still require a respite activity to complete. (See Chapter 12: Downtime Projects for more information.)

Additionally, if you have 24 hours or more before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have one or more clues or rumors regarding the encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a respite activity. The following test outcomes apply to a combat encounter:

* **≤11:** The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.
* **12-16:** The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the encounter.
* **17+:** The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and when the encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.

The following test outcomes apply to a negotiation:

* **≤11:** The Director gives you three motivations, one of which belongs to an NPC in the negotiation.
* **12-16:** The Director gives you one motivation for an NPC in the negotiation.
* **17+:** The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and you and each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the negotiation.

You can make this test only once for any encounter or negotiation.

#### Doctrine Triggered Action

Your tactical doctrine grants you a triggered action, as shown on the Doctrine Triggered Actions table.

###### Doctrine Triggered Actions Table

| Doctrine   | Triggered Action |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Insurgent  | Advanced Tactics |
| Mastermind | Overwatch        |
| Vanguard   | Parry            |

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Advanced Tactics</span>**

*Your leadership aids an ally.*

| **Ranged**       |   **Triggered** |
| ---------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One ally** |

**Trigger:** The target deals damage to another creature.

**Effect:** The target gains 2 surges, which they can use on the triggering damage.

**Spend 1 Focus:** If the damage has any potency effect associated with it, the potency is increased by 1.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Overwatch</span>**

*Under your direction, an ally waits for just the right moment to strike.*

| **Ranged**       |       **Triggered** |
| ---------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One creature** |

**Trigger:** The target moves.

**Effect:** At any time during the target's movement, one ally can make a free strike against them.

**Spend 1 Focus:** If the target has `▏R▕` < `▏AVERAGE▕`, they are slowed (EoT).

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Parry</span>**

*Your quick reflexes cost an enemy the precision they seek.*

| **Melee, Weapon** |           **Triggered** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 2**    | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Trigger:** A creature deals damage to the target.

**Effect:** You can shift 1 square. If the target is you, or if you end this shift adjacent to the target, the target takes half the damage. If the damage has any potency effect associated with it, the potency is decreased by 1.

**Spend 1 Focus:** This ability's distance becomes Melee 1 + your Reason score, and you can shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score instead of 1 square.

#### Field Arsenal

You have drilled with a broad array of arms and armor, and have developed techniques to optimize their use. You can use and gain the benefits of two kits, including both their signature abilities. Whenever you would choose or change one kit, you can choose or change your second kit as well. See Chapter 6: Kits for more information. (*Quick Build:* Shining Armor, Sniper.)

If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or the other and can't change your choice until you finish a respite. (This usually means taking the higher of two bonuses.)

For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the following benefits overall:

* Stamina Bonus: +12 per echelon
* Stability Bonus: +1
* Melee Damage Bonus: +2/+2/+2
* Ranged Damage Bonus: +0/+0/+4
* Speed Bonus: +1
* Ranged Distance Bonus: +10
* Disengage Bonus: +1
* You can use the Patient Shot and Protective Attack signature abilities.

Kit signature abilities have their kit's bonuses already applied, which might require you to adjust the bonuses of the signature abilities you gain from a kit. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from the Martial Artist kit loses the +2/+2/+2 bonus from that kit, reducing its usual 5/8/11 damage for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 outcomes to 3/6/9. It then gains the +0/+0/+4 of the Mountain kit to deal 3/6/13 damage.

#### Mark

You know how to focus the attention of your allies as you push them toward victory. You have the following ability.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Mark</span>**

*You draw your allies' attention to a specific foe—with devastating effect.*

| **Ranged**       |        **Maneuver** |
| ---------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One creature** |

**Effect:** The target is marked by you until the end of the encounter, until you are dying, or until you use this ability again. You can willingly end your mark on a creature (no action required), and if another tactician marks a creature, your mark on that creature ends. When a creature marked by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to mark a new target within distance.

You can initially mark only one creature using this ability, though other tactician abilities allow you to mark additional creatures at the same time. The mastermind tactical doctrine's Anticipation feature allows you to target additional creatures with this ability starting at 5th level.

While a creature marked by you is within your line of effect, you and allies within your line of effect gain an edge on power rolls made against that creature. Additionally, whenever you or any ally uses an ability to deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you, you can spend 1 focus to gain one of the following benefits as a free triggered action:

* The ability deals extra damage equal to twice your Reason score.
* The creature dealing the damage can spend a Recovery.
* The creature dealing the damage can shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score.
* If you damage a creature marked by you with a melee ability, the creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.

You can't gain more than one benefit from the same trigger.

**Effect:** The target can use a signature ability as a free triggered action.

#### Tactician Abilities

## Talent

Arare few people are born with the potential to harness psionic power, but only those who experience an awakening, a significant event that activates a talent's abilities, can tap into the mind's full potential. You are one of those people—a master of psionics and a source of incredible power created through sheer force of will. You can move and change matter, time, gravity, the laws of physics, or another creature's mind.

**As a talent, you are limited only by the strength of your mind. But the ability to wield multiple powers at once and change reality at will involves a gamble. Every manifestation has a chance of harming you, and talents who use too much power too quickly pay a deadly price.**

> "I've seen what you can do! There is NO LIMIT to your power! All you have to do... is BELIEVE!"
>
> **Khorva**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Reason of 2 and a Presence of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

* 2, −1, −1
* 1, 1, −1
* 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Reason − 2

**Average Potency:** Reason − 1

**Strong Potency:** Reason

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 6

**Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** You gain the Psionics and Read Person skills (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any two skills from the interpersonal or lore skill groups. (*Quick Build:* Empathize, Psionics, Read Person, Timescape.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level talent, you gain the following features.

#### Talent Tradition

Psionic abilities are grouped into categories according to their effects, with each category comprising one of many talent traditions:

* **Animapathy** abilities allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the souls of living things.
* **Chronopathy** abilities allow you to view future and past events, and to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes.
* **Cryokinesis** abilities allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute cold to enemies and the environment alike.
* **Metamorphosis** abilities allow you to strengthen and manipulate your body and the bodies of others to perform preternatural exploits.
* **Pyrokinesis** abilities allow you to create and manipulate fire by interacting with the potential energy found in all things.
* **Resopathy** abilities allow you to manipulate matter and space to create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects in it.
* **Telekinesis** abilities allow you to physically manipulate creatures and objects.
* **Telepathy** abilities allow you to communicate with, read, and influence the minds of other creatures.

You choose a talent tradition from the following options: chronopathy, telekinesis, or telepathy. Your talent tradition is your subclass, and your choice of tradition determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels. (Other talent traditions will be featured in future products.) (*Quick Build:* Telekinesis.)

#### Clarity and Strain

The focus and precision of your thoughts grant you a Heroic Resource called clarity that empowers your psionic abilities.

##### Clarity in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain clarity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 clarity.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that a creature is force moved, you gain 1 clarity.

You can spend clarity you don't have, pushing that Heroic Resource into negative numbers to a maximum negative value equal to 1 + your Reason score. At the end of each of your turns, you take 1 damage for each negative point of clarity.

Whenever you have clarity below 0, you are strained. Some psionic abilities have additional effects if you are already strained or become strained when you use them. Strained effects can still impact you even after you are no longer strained.

You lose any remaining clarity or reset any negative clarity at the end of the encounter.

##### Clarity Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs clarity, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

Additionally, whenever you use any ability or effect that costs clarity within 1 minute of using another such ability, you take 1d6 damage and incur any strain effect from using the new ability.

##### Drama in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain drama equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 drama.

Additionally, you gain drama when certain events occur during a combat encounter:

* The first time three or more heroes use an ability on the same turn, you gain 2 drama.
* The first time any hero is made winded during the encounter, you gain 2 drama.
* Whenever a creature within your line of effect rolls a natural 19 or 20, you gain 3 drama.
* When you or another hero dies, you gain 10 drama.

When you are dead, you continue to gain drama during combat as long as your body is intact. If you have 30 drama during the encounter in which you died, you can come back to life with 1 Stamina and 0 drama (no action required). If you are still dead after the encounter in which you died, you can't gain drama during future encounters.

You lose any remaining drama at the end of the encounter.

##### Drama Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain drama outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost drama without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs drama, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited drama on its effect, such as Artful Flourish, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of drama equal to your Victories.

> **The Auteur Troubadour**
>
> Abilities like Guest Star, Missed Cue, and Twist at the End allow the auteur to rewrite bits of what happens in the battle by temporarily removing creatures from an encounter, bringing people back to life, or causing a new ally to appear. These abilities and features are no more powerful than any other, but they're narratively different from shooting rays of fire or swinging a sword.
>
> This is because, uniquely among all the subclasses in *Draw Steel*, the auteur knows that the combat encounter playing out at your table is really a story being told sometime later, probably in a tavern.
>
> When the auteur uses these abilities, they are changing that story. They rewrite stories to make them more dramatic in the telling. What *actually* happened is a matter of some debate. Even the people who were there don't agree on exactly what took place. How people *remember* it is what's important!
>
> This is pretty weird, but also very fun. If it's too weird for you or your table, you could always interpret those abilities as a kind of magic. A school of conjuring that really does change the battlefield, which the auteur merely *flavors* as rewriting the story.

#### Kit

You can use and gain the benefits of a kit. See Chapter 6: Kits for more information. (*Quick Build:* Swashbuckler.)

#### Scene Partner

Whenever you obtain a success on a test to interact with an NPC using a skill from the interpersonal group, you can form a bond with that NPC. When you enter into a negotiation with a bonded NPC, their patience increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Additionally, the first time during a negotiation that you personally make an argument that would increase a bonded NPC's interest by 1, you instead increase their interest by 2 (to a maximum of 5).

You can have a number of bonds active equal to your level. When you form a bond with a new NPC that would exceed the limit, you must choose which of your active bonds to lose.

#### Routines

You enter every battle with a set of performance abilities at the ready. Performances are magical presentations (such as songs, dances, poems, or gymnastic feats) that your allies can participate in. These abilities have the Performance keyword. At the start of each combat round, as long as you are not dazed, dead, or surprised, you can either choose a new performance or maintain your current performance (no action required). Your performance lasts until you are unable to maintain it or until the end of the encounter.

You start off with the Choreography and Revitalizing Limerick performance abilities. Your choice of class act grants you additional performances.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Choreography</span>**

### 2nd-Level Features

As a 2nd-level troubadour, you gain the following features.

#### Appeal to the Muses

You can give a rousing speech, invoke your inspirations, or lift your fellows' spirits, appealing to the muses to heighten a battle's drama. However, irony is eager to hand your fortune to the villain to achieve the same end.

Before you roll to gain drama at the start of your turn, you can make your appeal (no action required). If you do, your roll gains the following additional effects:

* If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional drama. The Director gains 1d3 Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*).
* If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 Heroic Resource, which you can keep or give to an ally within the distance of your active performance. The Director gains 1 Malice.
* If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 of a Heroic Resource, which you can distribute among yourself and any allies within the distance of your active performance.

#### Invocation

You have a specific manner that helps define your presence on the battlefield. Choose one of the following features.

##### Allow Me to Introduce Tonight's Players

Whenever you take the first turn in a combat encounter, you can use a main action to introduce yourself and your allies to your opponents. Each ally can shift up to their speed, and ability rolls made against them have a double bane until the end of the combat round. Additionally, any surprised enemy is no longer surprised.

##### Formal Introductions

As a respite activity, you can scribe a notice of your arrival (such as a calling card or a formal letter) addressed to an enemy. You can deliver the notice to the target personally if you are in the same general area, send it by courier, or leave it in a covert location for the target to find. You can have only one notice active at a time.

The Director determines when the target receives your notice. When the target receives the notice, they become alarmed and take desperate measures to stop you. The Director gains 1 additional Malice per combat round during encounters involving the target. The heroes start each such encounter with 2 additional hero tokens (Chapter 1: The Basics). These hero tokens disappear at the end of the encounter.

##### My Reputation Precedes Me

You can invoke your reputation at the start of a social interaction with one or more NPCs who haven't met you before, automatically creating a bond with one of those NPCs from that group as if using your Scene Partner feature (above). This bond counts against the limit on active bonds from your Scene Partner feature. While the bond is active, all heroes present treat their Renown as 2 higher than usual for the purpose of entering into a negotiation with the bonded NPC.

The Director can award the heroes 1 hero token to make you infamous among the group of creatures instead, and preventing you from forming this bond. Until you take action to improve your reputation, all heroes present take a bane on tests made to interact with creatures in the group using skills from the interpersonal skill group. You can still use your Scene Partner feature to find allies within the group.

You gain one interpersonal, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice. See Chapter 7: Perks.

Neither of you can gain more Stamina than your maximum this way. You then make a power roll.
