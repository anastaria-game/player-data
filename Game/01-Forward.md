This document is an adaptation of the Draw Steel game by MCDM Productions.  Original game is highly recommended and is available here: https://www.mcdmproductions.com/

Much of the original game's lore and setting have been removed as this version is adapted for the West Marches campaign setting _Anastaria_.

The following chapters are unmodified or minor changes have been made to migrate to the _Anastaria_ setting (name changes, etc.)
* [Chapter 9: Perks](09-Perks.md)
* [Chapter 11: Tests](11-Tests.md)
* [Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md)
* [Chapter 13: Negotiation](13-Negotiation.md)
