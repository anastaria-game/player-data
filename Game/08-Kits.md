# Kits

The knight in shining armor. The warrior priest. The sniper. Censors, furies, shadows, tacticians, and troubadours can tap into these and many more archetypal concepts using kits. A kit is a combination of weapons, armor, and fighting techniques that lets you personalize your martial hero for battle.

### Changing Your Kit

Your choice of kit is always flexible, and your hero is never locked into a specific kit. If you want to change your kit, you can do so as a respite activity (see [Respite](03-Basics.md#respite) in [Chapter 3: Basics](03-Basics.md)).

### Kit Equipment

Each kit's equipment entry details the armor and weapons the kit provides. It's important to know what equipment a kit uses, because that informs your hero's appearance and story. Equipment is part of what affects the math behind your kit's benefits, alongside the fighting techniques each kit provides. Equipment also determines the type of magic and psionic treasures your character can wield.

The description of equipment in your kit is limited to broad categories, leaving you free to decide the specifics that best align with your vision of your character. For instance, the Guisarmier kit provides medium armor and a polearm. One player using this kit could wear heavy layers of hide and wield a longspear, while another might wear a shining breastplate and carry a halberd into battle.

You can wear armor and wield weapons that aren't part of your kit, but if you do, you don't get your kit's bonuses.


> **Customizing Equipment Appearances**
>
> You should absolutely feel free to describe your equipment in a way that makes sense for the story of your game and hero. For instance, if your hero uses a weapon in the whip category as part of their kit, they could use a leather whip, a spiked chain, or a dagger tied to a knotted rope. A hero who wears heavy armor might wear a suit of chain mail, plate armor, or heavy wooden planks tied together. Your choices for equipment aren't limited just to the examples in this book.

#### Kit Armor Categories

The armor provided by each kit fits into one of five categories, indicating the kind of protection you have while using the kit.

##### None

If a kit provides no armor, you can wear whatever clothing you like! Robes, a fashionable tunic and pants‚Äîor your character might just loincloth it. It's totally up to you.

##### Light Armor

If a kit features light armor, you might wear padded cloth, leather armor, or a chain shirt.

##### Medium Armor

If a kit has medium armor, you might wear layers of thick hides, a breastplate, or armor made of metal scales.

##### Heavy Armor

If a kit has heavy armor, then you're likely wearing metal from head to toe. Chain mail, ring mail, and suits of plate armor protect you better than any other mundane defense.

##### Shield

If a kit has a shield, then you wield a shield that can be any shape and made of any mundane material you like. The best shields have a sweet insignia on them, so start thinking about yours!

#### Kit Weapon Categories

The weapons provided by a kit fall into eight categories that indicate the types of weapons you wield while using the kit.

##### Bow

Bows cover any weapon used to fire an arrow or bolt projectile, including crossbows, longbows, and shortbows. This weapon group also includes weapons that hurl bullets, stones, darts, or small spears, including slings and atlatls. You don't need to track mundane ammunition for these weapons unless the Director says otherwise.

##### Ensnaring Weapon

Ensnaring weapons include bolas, nets, and other weapons made to capture an enemy and hold them in place.

##### Light Weapon

Light weapons are one-handed melee weapons that can be used to make several strikes in rapid succession. Many such weapons can be thrown or used as an off-hand defensive weapon. Daggers, shortswords, rapiers, handaxes, and throwing hammers are typical light weapons.

If your kit uses a light weapon, you can wield two light weapons at a time.

##### Medium Weapon

Medium weapons are one-handed melee weapons that can be carried into battle while leaving one hand free, allowing you to use that hand to hold a shield or implement. Battleaxes, clubs, longswords, and warhammers are medium weapons.

##### Heavy Weapon

Heavy weapons are two-handed melee weapons with weighty bladed or bludgeoning heads, made to seriously harm or kill enemies in a single mighty blow. Greatswords, greataxes, mauls, and morningstars are all examples of heavy weapons.

##### Polearm

Polearms are two-handed melee weapons with long hafts that increase the wielder's reach. They include glaives, halberds, longspears, and quarterstaffs.

##### Unarmed Strikes

Any kit that uses unarmed strikes allows you to use your body as a weapon. Punches, kicks, eye gouges, and the like are your forte.

##### Whip

Whip weapons include the standard whip, spiked chains, flails, and any similarly long and flexible melee weapon.

#### Kits and Treasures

When you find a supernatural treasure such as a magic sword, you can use the item as long as it's in one of your kit's equipment categories. For example, if a treasure is a medium weapon, it's suitable for kits like the Ranger or Shining Armor. Conversely, kits such as the Cloak and Dagger or Stick and Robe won't support it. If that's the case, you can still use it as an improvised weapon, but you won't get any bonuses or benefits.

If you find a piece of equipment you really want to use that isn't part of your kit, you can always change your kit as a respite activity.

### Kit Bonuses and Traits

A kit can grant a bonus to your Stamina, speed, and stability, as well as the damage and distance of your weapon abilities, including your free strikes. ([Abilities](07-Classes.md#abilities) in [Chapter 7: Classes](07-Classes.md) has information on abilities, ability keywords, and more.)

#### Stamina Bonus

Your kit's Stamina bonus is added to your Stamina maximum and scales with your echelon.

#### Speed Bonus

Your kit's speed bonus is added to your speed.

#### Stability Bonus

Your kit's stability bonus is added to your stability.

#### Damage Bonuses

Kits can grant you a bonus to damage with both melee and ranged weapon abilities. If a kit has a melee damage bonus, that bonus is added to the rolled damage of any damage-dealing ability with both the Melee and Weapon keywords. A kit's ranged damage bonus is added to the rolled damage of damage-dealing abilities with both the Ranged and Weapon keywords.

##### Bonuses Across Tiers

Kit damage bonuses increase based on the tier outcome of the power roll for a weapon ability, and are presented as "+X/+Y/+Z." The X bonus is added to a tier 1 outcome, the Y bonus is added to a tier 2 outcome, and the Z bonus is added to a tier 3 outcome.

For example, the Shining Armor kit has a +2/+2/+2 melee damage bonus, increasing the damage of melee weapon abilities across all tier outcomes. The Sniper kit has a +0/+0/+4 ranged damage bonus, having no effect on a tier 1 or tier 2 outcome on an ability roll, but increasing the damage of tier 3 outcomes by +4 for your ranged weapon abilities.

#### Distance Bonus

A kit's melee distance bonus increases the distance of abilities with the Melee and Weapon keywords. A kit's ranged distance bonus increases the distance of abilities with the Ranged and Weapon keywords.

A distance bonus doesn't increase the size of any ability's area of effect.

#### Disengage Bonus

A kit that has a disengage bonus increases the number of squares you can shift when you take the Disengage move action (see [Chapter 12: Combat](12-Combat.md)).

### Kit Signature Ability

Each kit grants a signature ability, **whose distance and damage already includes the kit's bonuses**. For instance, the Guisarmier kit's Forward Thrust, Backward Smash ability has a distance of melee 2 and deals 4, 7, or 9 damage depending on the tier outcome, with that distance and damage including the bonuses from the kit.

For details on the ability format,see [Abilities](07-Classes.md#abilities) in [Chapter 7: Classes](07-Classes.md).

### Kits A to Z

This section details each kit, whose bonuses and benefits are summarized in the Kits table.


> **Improvised Weapons**
>
> Improvised weapons include rocks, bottles, plates, furniture, and anything else you pick up that can be bashed, hurled, or stabbed into an enemy. As well, any weapons that aren't part of your kit count as improvised weapons for you. If you're not using a kit with unarmed strikes, then your feet and fists are improvised weapons. If you're not using any kit and pick up a sword to use as part of a melee free strike, the sword counts as an improvised weapon.
>
> Improvised weapons can be used with weapon abilities you gain from your class. For instance, many melee-focused heroes choose a kit that maximizes their melee capabilities, then make ranged free strikes with improvised weapons. However, you can't use improvised weapons with weapon abilities gained from your kit, and you add no special bonuses from your kit to a weapon ability used with an improvised weapon.

### Optional Rule: Losing Equipment

The rules of the game expect that heroes always have access to their equipment. However, there might be times where your group wants to tell a story of heroes who are captured and stripped of their equipment, or who find themselves at a masquerade where weapons need to be checked at the door. For those kinds of scenarios, you can use the following rules:

- If your kit has armor and you aren't wearing it or wielding it (in the case of a shield), you lose your kit's Stamina bonus and stability bonus. If you lose your shield but keep the rest of your armor, your Stamina decreases by 3 per echelon. As long as you are carrying your shield, you don't lose its Stamina bonus, even if you aren't actively wielding it.
- If your kit has a medium or heavy weapon you aren't wielding, you lose the kit's melee damage bonus.
- If your kit has a light weapon you aren't wielding, you lose the kit's melee damage bonus, ranged damage bonus, and distance bonus for a weapon you throw. If your kit also has a bow, you don't lose those benefits for the bow.
- If your kit has a polearm or whip you aren't wielding, you lose the kit's melee damage bonus and melee distance bonus.
- If your kit has an ensnaring weapon you aren't wielding, you lose the kit's signature ability.
- If your kit has a bow weapon you aren't wielding, you lose the kit's ranged damage bonus and distance bonus.

## Weight and Encumbrance

This document details the rules for managing carrying capacity and equipment weight in the campaign.

## Encumbrance Units

Each item in the game has an Encumbrance (Enc) value, representing its weight and bulk. These values are used to determine a character's carrying capacity.

* **Light Items:** Consumables, trinkets, small tools, and light weapons. Items with an "Enc" of 0, "\*", or "¬ß" are considered Light. Characters can carry an unlimited number of these without penalty.
* **Normal Items:** Items with an "Enc" of 1. These include medium armor, shields, and most adventuring gear.
* **Heavy Items:** Items with an "Enc" of 2. This includes heavy armor, bows, polearms, and heavy weapons.
* **Bulky Items:** Items with an "Enc" of 3 or more. These are large or unwieldy objects, such as a week's worth of rations or a full suit of heavy armor.

## Carrying Capacity and Penalties

A character's carrying capacity is based on their **Might** score. The total number of encumbrance units they carry determines their encumbrance level and any associated penalties.

| Might Score | Unencumbered | Lightly Encumbered | Heavily Encumbered |
| :---------- | :----------- | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| -3          | 0-1          | 2-3                | 4+                 |
| -2          | 0-2          | 3-5                | 6+                 |
| -1          | 0-3          | 4-7                | 8+                 |
| 0           | 0-5          | 6-9                | 10+                |
| 1           | 0-6          | 7-11               | 12+                |
| 2           | 0-8          | 9-13               | 14+                |
| 3           | 0-9          | 10-15              | 16+                |
| 4           | 0-11         | 12-17              | 18+                |
| 5           | 0-13         | 14-19              | 20+                |

### Encumbrance Penalties

* **Unencumbered:** No penalties.
* **Lightly Encumbered:** Suffer a **-1 penalty** to all **Agility** and **Dexterity** checks. Your speed is reduced by **1**.
* **Heavily Encumbered:** Suffer a **-2 penalty** to all **Agility** and **Might** checks. Your speed is reduced by **2**. A **Forced March** is not possible.
* **Overburdened:** A character's encumbrance exceeds the Heavily Encumbered threshold. They cannot move and suffer a **-4 penalty** to all rolls.

## Carrying and Dragging

A character may need to carry or drag an unconscious or disabled companion. The rules for this are as follows:

* **Carrying:** Lifting and carrying a companion adds an encumbrance of **3 units** to the character. This action requires a successful **Might** check (difficulty set by the DM) to perform. A failure means the character drops the companion.
* **Dragging:** Dragging a companion adds an encumbrance of **2 units** to the character. Dragging a companion reduces the character's speed to 1 and applies the **Heavily Encumbered** penalty to all rolls. Dragging does not require a Might check to perform.

## Equipment, Armor, and Weapons

This document details a selection of example gear appropriate for most fantasy campaigns. The GM is expected to add other items that might suit their particular world.

### Money and Currency

The game uses dreg (√∞), fleck ( É), and shard ( Ç) coins in general circulation, with ten dregs to a fleck and ten flecks to a shard piece. Fleck is the base currency; one fleck is a typical laborer‚Äôs daily wage.
