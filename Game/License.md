# Draw Steel Creator License

**Note:** This license applies to ~~this~~ the original book, *Draw Steel Heroes.*

## Just a few basic rules:

- If you adhere to these terms, you are allowed to publish works based upon and/or declare compatibility with *DRAW STEEL* without express permission from MCDM Productions, LLC ("MCDM," "we," "us," or "our").
- You agree not to copy or reproduce any art from our books unless you have our explicit permission in writing.
- You may use our visual designs as inspiration to create your own original illustrations.
- You can reuse and freely reference the *DRAW STEEL* text, mechanics, and game rules, including proper names, locations, and characters.
- Your product cannot use the MCDM logo or the *DRAW STEEL* logo unless you have our explicit permission in writing.
- You are allowed and encouraged (but not required) to use the *DRAW STEEL* compatibility logo. (*<https://mcdm.gg/ds-license>*)
- The following text must be included both (a) in the legal text visible on the outside of your product, and (b) on the website or storefront where you promote the product: "[Product Name] is an independent product published under the *DRAW STEEL* Creator License and is not affiliated with MCDM Productions, LLC. DRAW STEEL Â© 2024 MCDM Productions, LLC."
- You're not allowed to give the impression that your product is an official *DRAW STEEL* product or that MCDM endorses or sponsors you or your product in any way.
- MCDM takes no responsibility for any legal claims against your product. You agree not to bring any claim against MCDM based on or arising from your use of *DRAW STEEL* content.
- You agree that your product will not violate or infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party. For example, don't make a product with Wolverine or Darth Vader in a *DRAW STEEL* setting.

## And a few general terms:

- Any legal disputes, controversies, or claims related to this license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and be heard before a court in the United States of America.
- You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold MCDM and its owners, officers, directors, employees, assigns, agents, affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any liability, claims, actions, demands, and damages (including attorneys' fees and costs) arising from or relating to your product or your exercise of any rights granted in this license.
- MCDM may modify or revise this license at any time in its sole discretion by posting the amended license on its website located at https://mcdm.gg/DS-license and announcing the change on at least one of MCDM's social media channels. The modification or revision will become effective after such postings. MCDM will indicate on the license the date it was last amended. You are responsible for checking the license regularly for changes, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of changes.
- Our license amendments will not be retroactive. If we amend the license, it will only apply to MCDM content that we release after we announce an amendment. Any of our content that was released before an amendment will still be covered by the old license. You can thus create a product based on our content today knowing that we're not going to switch up the license terms on you down the road. If you have a product that you're selling or that's in development at the time MCDM issues a license amendment, you can continue distributing that product plus any updates, modified versions, and derivative works under the terms of the license that was in place prior to the amendment even if you do not agree to the license as amended. In other words, we're not going to make you choose between killing off your work or accepting terms you don't like.
- If you fail to comply with this license, your rights under this License terminate automatically and without notice. On termination of this license, you agree to immediately stop sharing or distributing any product created under this license.
