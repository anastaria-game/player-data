# Origin

Every character in Fortitude is defined by where they came from. Were you born amidst the mud and chaos of this new world, or were you cast out of the old one? Your origin will shape your worldview, your skills, and how the people of Fortitude interact with you.

## The *Exiled* (First Generation)

You are a newcomer from the Loom, sent to Anastaria within the last few years. You were a criminal, a political dissident, a disgraced noble, or simply someone whose ambition or wanderlust could not be tolerated in the rigid peace of the Great Accord. You are a fish out of water, haunted or comforted by memories of a world you can never return to.

## The *Wyldborn* (Second Generation)

You were born in Anastaria. The eerie twilight of the Veridian Eye is the only sky you have ever known, and the psychic hum of the Wyld is as natural to you as your own heartbeat. The Loom is a collection of stories your parents tell, a mythical place of impossible quiet and order. You are a pragmatist and a survivor.

## Wyld Acclimatization

Regardless of your background, you'll need to be aware of Wyld Acclimatization.

### Acclimatizing to the Wyld

No creature of the Loom can spend time in Anastaria and remain unchanged. The pervasive, chaotic life energy of the Wyld slowly seeps into your very being, a process known as Wyld Acclimatization. This is not a curse or a disease, but a gradual transformation that offers new strengths at the cost of your connection to the ordered world you left behind.

You are responsible for tracking your own *Wyld Acclimatization (WA)* score on your character sheet. The longer you spend in the wilds, the more it will rise. The more time you spend in the ordered safety of Fortitude, the more it will fall.

#### Standard Rate of Change

- ***-1 WA*** for every 1 day spent within the Founders' Ring, near the stabilizing influence of Weir's Lantern.
- ***+1 WA*** for every 1 day spent in the Penumbra.
- ***+2 WA*** for every 1 day spent in the Deep Wyld.

*Note: Certain unusual events can cause more rapid change in a short time.*

### Tiers of Acclimatization

The effects of WA manifest in tiers. A character gains all boons and banes of their current tier and all tiers below it.

#### 0-9 WA: Loom-Bound

- **Edge:** You receive an edge to saving throws against the psychic effects of the Wyld's "hum."
- **Bane:** You receive a bane to Survival checks to navigate or forage in the Penumbra and Deep Wyld. Your scent is jarringly alien, giving Wyld predators an edge to checks to track you.

#### 10-19 WA: Penumbra-Adapted

- **Edge:** You can correctly interpret the simplest of T'choac pheromonal signals (danger, food, aggression). You gain a primal intuition, granting you an edge on checks to avoid being surprised by natural creatures.
- **Bane:** The perfect order of the Loom feels slightly foreign. You receive a bane to checks to operate or repair complex, non-magical technology from the Loom (e.g., a Combine surveyor's kit).

#### 20-29 WA: Wyld-Fluent

- **Edge:** You gain an edge to resist natural Anastarian poisons and diseases. Minor cosmetic changes begin to appear (a faint shimmer to the eyes, skin taking on a slightly tougher, bark-like texture).
- **Bane:** The stabilizing influence of Weir's Lantern feels oppressive. While within the Founders' Ring, you receive a bane on all **Presence**-based checks when dealing with "civilized" NPCs like Combine officials or Lady Evandra.

#### 30+ WA: The Unknown

As your connection to the Wyld deepens, the changes become more profound and unpredictable. The boons may be great, but the cost to your original nature is severe. The ultimate consequences of such deep acclimatization are not fully understood, but the fate of those who have walked this path before serves as a dire warning.

# Ancestries

Fantastic peoples inhabit the worlds of *Draw Steel*. Among them are dwarves, elves—and of course humans, whose culture and history dominates many worlds.

Your hero is one of these folks! The fantastic ancestry you choose bestows benefits that come from your anatomy and physiology. This choice doesn't grant you cultural benefits, such as crafting or lore skills, though. While many game settings have cultures made of mostly one ancestry, other cultures and worlds have a cosmopolitan mix of peoples.

In *Draw Steel*, ancestry describes how you were born. [Culture](06-Background.md#culture) in [Chapter 6: Background](06-Background.md) describes how you grew up. If you want to be a wode elf who was raised in a forest among other wode elves, you can do that! If you want to play a wode elf who was raised in an underground city of dwarves, humans, and orcs, you can do that too!

This chapter details six ancestries for the game:

**Dwarf:** Humanoids with stony skin, dwarves have short and stout bodies. Many carve supernatural runes into their flesh, and some have beards made of crystals.

**Wode Elf:** Lithe humanoids with finely furred skin in all shades of blue, wode elves have angular features and large, pointed ears akin to a bat's. They possess a supernatural glamor that allows them to blend in with their surroundings when they wish to hide.

**High Elf:** Stately and graceful, high elves have tall, willowy bodies, pointed ears, and smoother skin than most other humanoids. Rare metal inlays such as gold, platinum, palladium, and iridium act as organic components within their skin. The truest form of any high elf is hidden from most—sometimes even from themself—thanks to a supernatural glamor that makes them more attractive to others, whatever that might mean to an individual. This glamor transcends physical appearance, also slightly altering a high elf's tone and smell.

**Hakaan:** Descended from stone giants, the mighty hakaan stand over 9 feet tall and have well-muscled bodies made of organic stone. They are the largest ancestry in this book!

**Human:** Humans are the most numerous people in many fantasy worlds! In *Draw Steel*, humans have all the diversity that our species displays in real life—and they can sense the presence of supernatural energy!

**Polder:** The smallest of the ancestries in this book, polders stand no taller than 3-1/2 feet. They look like smaller humans, and they have the ability to blend in with the shadows.

### On the Origin of Species

Fantasy worlds abound with diverse peoples, each shaped by the forces that birthed them. Some attribute this diversity to ancient creator gods, while others see it as the natural result of magical experimentation or evolutionary pressures. In many settings, mortals—wizards and scholars—have attempted to emulate the gods, creating new intelligent species through powerful rituals or arcane processes.

These attempts often lead to unintended consequences. New peoples gain self-awareness and autonomy, rebelling against their creators or integrating into society in unexpected ways. The ethical dilemmas of creation—uplifting simple creatures into intelligent beings or crafting servitors that exceed their intended purpose—arise frequently in epic tales. Stories warn of hubris, where creators are outmatched by their creations.

You can adapt these concepts to your world. Perhaps species were molded by divine wills, evolved naturally, or sprang from mortal ambition. The key is to choose elements that inspire your narrative and make the setting feel uniquely yours.

### Names by Ancestry

Obviously you're free to invent whatever name you want for your character! And your director might have their own setting that uses different cultures than those in Orden. But if you want to pick an Orden-appropriate name for your hero, keep reading.

Equally obviously; names are cultural, not biological. Your character probably has a name appropriate to whatever culture they were born into, or grew up in. A human raised by hakaan would probably have a hakaan name.

#### Last Names and Bynames

Most people living in Orden—and this is especially true of Vasloria live in villages. They do not have and do not use last names or family names. Everyone in the village knows who you mean when you refer to "William." Even if there's more than one William in the village, you can usually tell who someone's referring to from context. Sometimes folks prepend "our" to someone's name meaning: the one related to or otherwise concerned with me and my family. "Our William" for instance.

If that's not enough, folks use another identifier known as a byname. If there were two boys in the village named Much, one of them might be called Much the Miller's Son, to distinguish them from the other lad.

If you leave your village regularly, say to trade with others in a distant market, then your byname might be the place you're from. Alan from the village in the dale, might become known as Alan from the Dale, or even Alan-a-Dale. But everyone back home just calls you Alan.

A byname might refer to your profession. Clyde the Cartwright is a perfectly normal byname. But no one you met would assume "Cartwright" was your 'family name.' People who live permanently in a very large city use family names, because almost no first name is sufficiently unique to identify you, and "Marissa the Cartwright's Daughter" quickly evolves into Marissa Cartwright.

Most nobles in Orden also use the name of the area they rule as part of their name. When someone refers to Lord Edmund Bedegar everyone listening silently, without thinking about it, adds "of" between the name and the place. Edmund is both Edmund, and the Lord of Bedegar, and Edmund, Lord of Bedegar, and therefore sometimes Lord Edmund Bedegar. Even though "Bedegar" looks like a "last name" to us, and is being used in that manner sometimes, it's not exactly his last name. It's still just another kind of byname.

Unlike remote villages, well settled areas where many towns and villages are all networked by roads often do use surnames to help differentiate one William from the other twenty within a densely populated area.

#### Names and Gender

Most cultures in Vasloria make a distinction between masculine and feminine names, though not all do. And for some cultures that make such a distinction, almost no one outside the culture can tell the difference.

Among those cultures which do make a distinction between masculine and feminine names, there are always names that *could* refer to a person of any gender. Here in the real world, you can't tell a person's gender just from the name "Shane." This is mostly because which names are considered masculine or feminine changes over time, and when this happens, there's a period—maybe a few generations—where the name could refer to a person of any gender.

Of course, there's no law (neither metaphorically nor literally) that requires your character to go by their birth name. They might not even know their birth name depending on what happened after they were born. It's not unusual, especially among talents, for a hero to adopt a moniker or sobriquet instead of a name. And in some cultures, there's a tradition of changing your name—or at least how you prefer to be known—as you go through different stages of life. High elves sometimes adopt a wholly new name when they reach a certain age, or more commonly, they choose a different component of their name. When A Mist Curls Around Dying Embers was a young woman, she was known as Mist. Now that she's the master of the Tower of Translation, she's known as Embers.

#### Authentic or Comedic?

For some players choosing a "good name"-by which they mean "authentic to the setting"-is important and can take a while. Because the right name can ground a character in the world, and this can help the player feel more immersed in the fictional reality. It also communicates to the other players that you're serious about the game and your hero.

For other players, choosing a comedic, joke name communicates the opposite! You are here to have fun and screw around and taking things seriously is something you already have to do all week, and so you pick a ridiculous name just to get a laugh because that's what you're serious about.

The choice of name is an important one, because it says a lot about you and how you view the game as a whole.

#### Example Names By Ancestry

**Gender Neutral:** Arzak, Keth, Orikk, Q'ir, Qoroth

**Masculine:** Darzok, Dazran, Djorek, Durok, Duur, Gavok, Kaaz, Kazaan, Zaar, Zarek

##### Wode Elf Names

Elves in general have a casual attitude toward gender, it having no direct bearing on procreation for them. (Normal elf upon learning how humans mate: "You mean... like animals?") They tend to view the various sex-linked traits associated among other ancestries with masculinity or femininity as a kind of fashion to be taken up or discarded as the mood suits. Over one life, any elf might wear masculine features, or feminine features, or both, many times. For wode elves, this often means adopting a new name, or a different version of the same name. Llyandros might become Llyandra for instance.

**Feminine:** Elvyr, Eviarwyc, Illwyv, Iorwyth, Lliarwyn, Meithennyn, Nimuë, Rhegyth, Viarwyn, Ysallwyth

**Masculine:** Calliarwyc, Cillyv, Eidior, Ffyllwyc, Gwyllmach, Llyandros, Ogllvar, Radiarwyn, Ryll, Tafirdwyn

##### High Elf Names

High elf names are poetic. They are an attempt to capture a fleeting, often contradictory, impulse, or emotion. They sometimes contain references to the natural world. They are never meant to be taken literally and they are not an attempt to make a character feel heroic.

**Examples:** The Anticipation of a Sigh Upon His Lips, A Crown of Starlight on Winter Snow, The Earth Cries the Skies Divide, Echoes of Autumn Heat, Edges of a Leaf Torn by the Wind, Every Flake of Snow a Memory, A Heart That Will Not Yield the Stars, The Last Star Fading With Morning, A Rain of Glass Over a Sea of Dreams, The Sun Reflected in a Lover's Tear

##### Polder Names

For reasons not well understood, polders in use surnames. First names seem chosen to imply a degree of sophistication (or, at least, what polders consider sophisticated) while last names are typically common, compound words. No one knows why they do this.

**Feminine:** Agatha, Amaryllis, Beverly, Esmerelda, Marceline, Modesty, Penelope, Rosemarie, Ursula, Weatherly

**Gender Neutral:** Bellamy, Bethell, Carrington, Madison, Mallory

**Masculine:** Aimsley, Alderson, Bancroft, Beechwood, Billingsworth, Broderick, Langston, Owlswick, Patterson, Willoughby

**Surnames:** Bottlebrush, Bracegirdle, Cheesewright, Cobblestone, Cordwainer, Lamplighter, Pinwhistle, Thistlethrush, Twobuckle, Underhill

### Measurements

How tall is a polder? How long does a dwarf live? The Ancestry Measurements table provides the average adult height and weight ranges and life expectancy for each of the ancestries in this chapter. These measurements are only averages, and many folks in the world exist outside of them, so your hero can too!

Humans have the potential to live a little longer than they do in the real world thanks to the presence of magic.

###### Ancestry Measurements Table

| Ancestry      | Height in Feet/ Inches | Weight in Pounds | Life Expectancy in Years |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Dwarf         | 4'0''-4'6''               | 500-1,000           | 700-1,500                   |
| Wode Elf      | 5'6''-6'6''               | 100-150             | 1,200-3,000                 |
| High Elf      | 5'6''-6'6''               | 100-150             | 1,200-3,000                 |
| Hakaan        | 9'0''-10'0''              | 1,000-2,000         | 300-500                     |
| Human         | 5'0''-6'0''               | 100-300             | 70-120                      |
| Polder        | 3'3''-3'6''               | 20-50               | 50-90                       |

### Starting Size and Speed

Unless otherwise noted, a character of any of these ancestries is size 1M and has speed 5 and stability 0.

Where an ancestry provides you with an ability, see Abilities in Chapter 7: Classes for details of the ability format.

### Ancestry Traits

Each ancestry has one or more signature traits, which your hero gets for free if they take that ancestry. This is a defining feature that other heroes of your ancestry also possess.

Ancestries also have purchased traits, but you don't get every purchased trait your ancestry has to offer. Instead, your ancestry provides a budget of ancestry points you can use to select traits. Each trait has a point cost that you pay to grant its benefit to your hero.

## Dwarf

Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone—a silico-organic hybrid making them physically denser than other humanoids. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves.

Dwarves are the children of the elder god Ord, and a common phrase among dwarves is "Ord made the world"-their way of saying, "What will be, will be." They take great pride in knowing that their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord's name.

### Dwarf Traits

Dwarf heroes have access to the following traits.

#### Signature Trait: Runic Carving

You can carve a rune onto your skin with 10 uninterrupted minutes of work, which is activated by the magic within your body. The rune you carve determines the benefit you receive, chosen from among the following:

**Detection:** Pick a specific type of creature (such as goblins or humans) or object (such as gems or potions). Your rune glows softly when you are within 20 squares of any creature or object of that type, even if you don't have line of effect to the creature or object. You can change the type of creature or object as a maneuver.

**Light:** Your skin sheds light for 10 squares. You can turn this light on and off as a maneuver.

**Voice:** As a maneuver, you can communicate telepathically with a willing creature you have met before and who is within 1 mile of you. You must know the creature's name, and they must speak and understand a language you know. You and the creature can respond to one another as if having a spoken conversation. You can communicate with a different creature by changing the rune.

You can have one rune active at a time, and can change or remove a rune with 10 uninterrupted minutes of work.

##### Stone Singer (1 Point)

You have a magic connection to the earth. When you spend 1 uninterrupted hour singing, you can reshape any unworked mundane stone within 3 squares. You can't destroy this stone, but you can move each square of it anywhere within 3 squares, piling it off to one side to dig a hole or building it up to create a wall.

## Wode Elf

Children of the sylvan celestials and masters of the elf-haunted forests called wodes, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. Humans *should* fear the trees.

The wode elves' natural ability to mask their presence, called *glamor*, complements their guerilla style of fighting, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make the relatively few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.

### Wode Elf Traits

Wode elf heroes have access to the following traits.

#### Signature Trait: Wode Elf Glamor

You can magically alter your appearance to better blend in with your surroundings. You gain an edge on tests made to hide and sneak, and tests made to search for you while you are hidden take a bane.

## High Elf

Children of the solar celestials created to tend their libraries and attend to the true elves as heralds, high elf history describes a better age, before the coming of humans and war. A time when the celestials were still in the world, and all that mattered was art and beauty.

In the millennia since their creators retired to Arcadia, the high elves built a civilization for themselves, primarily living in and among the fallen celestial sky cities. With no creators left to please, the elves continue as they did before—collecting lore and knowledge, worshipping art, and turning more inward and distrusting of outsiders with each generation.

### High Elf Traits

High elf heroes have access to the following traits.

#### Signature Trait: High Elf Glamor

A magic glamor makes others perceive you as interesting and engaging, granting you an edge on Presence tests using the Flirt or Persuade skills. This glamor makes you appear and sound slightly different to each creature you meet, since what is engaging to one might be different for another. However, you never appear to be anyone other than yourself.

#### Purchased High Elf Traits

You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits. (*Quick Build:* High Senses, Otherworldly Grace.)

##### Glamor of Terror (2 Points)

##### Graceful Retreat (1 Point)

You gain a +1 bonus to the distance you can shift when you take the Disengage move action.

##### High Senses (1 Point)

Your elf body and mind can't be contained for long. Whenever you make a saving throw, you succeed on a roll of 5 or higher.

Accessing memories is as easy as living in the present for you. You gain an edge on tests made to recall lore.

##### Unstoppable Mind (2 Points)

Your mind allows you to maintain your focus in any situation. You can't be made dazed.

## Hakaan

In spite of their friendly, outgoing nature, the rare presence of a hakaan in human society is considered a harbinger. An omen of dark times.

Descended from a tribe of giants in upper Vanigar, the original Haka'an tribe made a bargain with Holkatya the Vanigar trickster god. They traded some of their gigantic size and strength for the ability to see the future.

But Holkatya betrayed them, and the only future a hakaan is allowed to see is the moment and nature of their own death. These visions are never of some mundane tragedy. No hakaan ever received a vision of dying from choking on a grape. This Doomsight is always momentous. Always dramatic.

The Doomsight can happen at any moment. It does not come for all or even most hakaan, but when it comes, it is considered an act of overwhelming hubris to ignore it. Trying to escape the Doomsight means a painful, tragic death, and cursing your family to live with shame.

But the only hakaan the average human meets is one trying to fulfill their doom. The human superstition—that the arrival of one or more hakaan in human lands is a sign of great forces acting in the world, auspicious times—is literally true. In dark times, many hakaan experience the Doomsight and leave their communities to venture out into the mundane world, in search of their destiny.

Humans in Vanigar have their own word for this concept of a personal fate. "Wyrd." Traditional hakaan sometimes refer to the Doomsight as "wyrdken."

### Hakaan Traits

Hakaan heroes have access to the following traits.

#### Signature Trait: Big!

Your stature reflects your giant forebears. Your size is 1L.

#### Purchased Hakaan Traits

You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits. (*Quick Build:* Doomsight, Forceful.)

##### All Is a Feather (1 Point)

You are exceptionally strong. You gain an edge on tests made to lift and haul heavy objects.

##### Doomsight (2 Points)

Working with your Director, you can predetermine an encounter in which you will die. When that encounter begins, you become doomed. While doomed, you automatically obtain a tier 3 outcome on tests and ability rolls, and you don't die no matter how low your Stamina falls. You then die immediately at the end of the encounter, and can't be returned to life by any means.

If you don't predetermine your death encounter, you can choose to become doomed while you are dying with the Director's approval (no action required). Doing so should be reserved for encounters in which you are dying as a result of suitable heroism, such as making a last stand against a boss or saving civilians, or when the consequences of your actions have finally caught up to you—not because you're playing a one-shot and have nothing to lose, Hacaarl.

Additionally, when your Stamina reaches the negative of your winded value and you are not doomed, you turn to rubble instead of experiencing death. You are unaware of your surroundings in this state, and you can't regain Stamina or have this effect undone in any way. After 12 hours, you regain Stamina equal to your recovery value.

##### Forceful (1 Point)

Whenever you force move a creature or object, the forced movement distance gains a +1 bonus.

##### Great Fortitude (2 Points)

Your hearty constitution prevents you from losing strength. You can't be made weakened.

##### Stand Tough (1 Point)

Your body is made to withstand the blows of your enemies. Your Might score is treated as 1 higher for the purpose of resisting potencies, and you gain an edge on Might tests when called for to resist environmental effects or a creature's traits or abilities.

## Human

Humans belong to the world in a way the other speaking peoples do not. You can sense the presence of the supernatural—that... oily smell in the air, as I've heard it described. And the presence of deathless causes the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up. Or why do you think graveyards affect you so? Whatever magic is, its grip on you is light. Whatever drives the deathless, your nature rebels against it.

"No one knows why this should be. We elves have no such senses. Nor do the elementals or the kanin... the dwarves and the orcs as you say. What is it that sets humans apart? I am an historian, not a physician. I cannot say. Perhaps some of you will one day find out and teach us all the reason."

### Human Traits

Human heroes have access to the following traits.

#### Signature Trait: Detect the Supernatural

As a maneuver, you can open your awareness to detect supernatural creatures and phenomena. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any supernatural object, or any undead, construct, or creature from another world within 5 squares, even if you don't have line of effect to that object or creature. You know if you're detecting an item or a creature, and you know the nature of any creature you detect.

#### Purchased Human Traits

You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits. (*Quick Build:* Perseverance, Staying Power.)

##### Can't Take Hold (1 Point)

Your connection to the natural world allows you to resist certain supernatural effects. You ignore temporary difficult terrain created by magic and psionic abilities. Additionally, when you are force moved by a magic or psionic ability, you can reduce the forced movement distance by 1.

##### Determination (2 Points)

A tolerance for pain and distress allows you to push through difficult situations. If you are frightened, slowed, or weakened, you can use a maneuver to immediately end one of those conditions.

##### Perseverance (1 Point)

Giving up is for other people. You gain an edge on tests made using the Endurance skill. Additionally, when you are slowed, your speed is reduced to 3 instead of 2.

##### Resist the Unnatural (1 Point)

Your instinctive resilience protects you from injuries beyond the routine. Whenever you take damage that isn't untyped, you can use a triggered action to take half the damage.

##### Staying Power (2 Points)

Your human physiology allows you to fight, run, and stay awake longer than others. You increase your number of Recoveries by 2.


## Polder

After humans, polders are the most numerous and diverse ancestry in Orden. They are not humans, but they live in and among humans and share their gods and culture. Almost every human culture in Orden has a polder saint or a human saint venerated by polder.

Short, averaging 31/2 feet tall, the polders' origins are obscure. They are a young species who, like humans, have no single patron god. Their ability to *shadowmeld* means they enjoy a reputation as excellent spies and thieves. Many polders consider this a base slander and point out they're also famed as chefs, though polders can be found in every profession, especially in cities.

**<span class="steel-compendium-ability">Shadowmeld</span>**

*You become an actual shadow.*

| **Magic**   | **Main action** |
| ----------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Self** |     **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** You flatten yourself into a shadow against a wall or floor you are touching, and become hidden from any creature you have cover or concealment from or who isn't observing you. While in shadow form, you have full awareness of your surroundings, and strikes made against you and tests made to search for you take a bane. You can't move or be force moved, and you can't take main actions or maneuvers except to exit this form or to direct creatures under your control, such as one you summon using an ability. Any ability or effect that targets more than 1 square affects you in this form only if it explicitly affects the surface you are flattened against. You can exit this form as a maneuver.

If the surface you are flattened against is destroyed, this ability ends and you take 1d6 damage that can't be reduced in any way.

#### Signature Trait: Small!

Your diminutive stature lets you easily get out of—or into—trouble. Your size is 1S.

Courage is all you know. You can't be made frightened.

##### Graceful Retreat (1 Point)

Your small size makes it easier for you to slip away from the fray. You gain a +1 bonus to the distance you can shift when you take the Disengage move action.

##### Nimblestep (2 Points)

A light step serves you well when speed is of the essence. You ignore the effects of difficult terrain and can move at full speed while sneaking.

##### Polder Geist (1 Point)

Evading others' notice gives you freedom to move. At the start of each of your turns during combat, if no enemy has line of effect to you or if you are hidden from or have concealment from any enemy with line of effect to you, you gain a +3 bonus to speed until the end of your turn.

##### Reactive Tumble (1 Point)

Staying light on your feet lets you quickly get back into position. Whenever you are force moved, you can use a free triggered action to shift 1 square after the forced movement is resolved.
